      "You don’t know what you’re talking about. Let me tell you how things are going. I’m involved in mining. We had a drop in bitcoin over the past two days. It hit quite a few cryptocurrencies, but it also flushed out quite a few scam currencies — people who are buying into them like gamblers have lost a lot of money in.\n",
      "My one and only partner has been showing his understanding of blockchain technology over the past two days. Bitcoin is something you want to look at as more of an indicator that indicates how all of the other currencies are doing. So if it drops, it means all of the other ones have fallen too most likely. South Korea was behind the latest drop, but anyway without going into crazy detail the effect of a decline in Bitcoin results in blockchain tech scammers getting exposed that are trying to creep up from the bottom of the earnings. Drops like this are a good thing. STOP acting like Bitcoin is gold or some kind of investment that you can gamble on. The same goes for the other cryptos. They are forms of tech that you can research and look into and ask corporations who are implementing them what is promising on the horizon.\n",
      "What my genius partner does is that when things drop, he’s keeping an eye on what is called dapps, which is just the word app with a ‘d’ tagged on the front. And apps are applications as in computer software applications. So dapps are applications written for blockchain technology. And there are all of these companies out there writing new blockchain apps that are better than the existing ones. And as corporate, scientific, and educational R&D departments discover these new dapps, they try them out to see if they are better than the ones they are using. If they are, they start jumping on board and using them to process their research over the blockchain network.\n",
      "See, crypto gets it value because it is a tech being used to perform work. Bitcoin’s work is recording transactions. Ethereum based crypto is being used to deliver scientific, marketing, and design research. Fortune 500 companies are using this instead of renting supercomputers. Pull your heads out of your rears and stop going to Wall Street to buy into this stuff. Those people are mostly idiots who just want to take their cut out of your “investment” in the form of fees. If your Wall Street rep can’t discuss dapps with you, run away!!!!!!!\n",
      "So what my genius partner has gotten beyond awesome at is watching these lists of dapps and seeing which ones are taking off and swapping them into his mining app setup for the dapps that are underperforming. He looks directly at the tech companies writing these dapps and figures out whether these companies writing these dapps are scams or legit. It’s easy to see because you can go to Microsoft and DuPont and universities and ask if they are actually using the dapp that these app writers claim they are buying into.\n",
      "So, my genius partner only services a certain number of dapps on his “supercomputer” mining machine, and as he finds ones that are performing better, he drops his poorest performer and puts in the new one to see if it ears us more returns.\n",
      "Quick note: mining machines are up to 40x cheaper to use than traditional supercomputers. That is why companies are flocking to blockchain. IT ISN’T MAGIC! IT ISN’T INSIDER TRADING!!! PULL YOUR HEADS OUT OF YOUR BUTTS AND DO SOME RESEARCH!!!!\n",
      "How do you do research? Install NiceHash on a computer and pretend you are a miner. It is foolish for you to get into mining if you are a corporation because it is impossible IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE for you to compete with small operations like my genius friend. These companies that sell hosted mining are scams!!!! DO NOT SUPPORT THEM. THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!\n",

      "If you are not an expert, but you have a close friend or loved one who is, and they really want to be a miner, and they start getting into it, and they have proven they are good at it…. THEN begin investing in their computer. Set up a “company” between you and your fellow investors, give this person your money to buy equipment. Divide up the company based on investor inputs. Payout to members based on investment. Pay your friend a % of returns that he/she sets. Then leave your friend alone 100% of the time and let them focus on making your mining machine and keeping as optimal as possible. Helping them by providing them security and a place to build and a place that is easy to cool and a place that has a high power supply that is as cheap as possible, and you will have the best investment there is for your cryptocurrency interest. Otherwise, you need to think of your purchases of crypto as gambling on the same level as horseracing, and when you lose your money, it is your fault for wasting it at the track.\n",

      "The best way to double your bitcoin easily these days is to invest with BitConnect or Bitpetite.\n",
      "At cryptoinvestor2008.com - Crypto Currencies are the new Gold! we started investing with BitConnect first and then we moved to Bitpetite after speaking for long time with the CEO. The biggest difference between the two is that with the first one, BitConnect, your principal is locked in for at very least 120 days (only if you invest more than 10000). With the second one instead,Bitpetite, you do not have to wait to get your principal back. However, we have been able to generate a ROI of 151% over a six weeks period. So, if you invest 2 BitCoins in Bitpetite and you chose the Btc/Btc option which means your interest is paid in Bitcoin, you are going to more than double your BitCoin holdings.\n",
      "Bitpetite's main source of income is our popular Bitcoin Tumbler. Generally, when a transaction moves along the blockchain it is NOT completely anonymous, as some people tend to believe. Many people, for their own reasons, do not want their transactions to be traceable along the blockhain. So a tumbler takes a whole bunch of BTC and mixes them together to essentially \"hide\" that one transaction, and people are happy to pay a fee for this service.\n",

      "The fact that Bitcoin has no central authority is what many people see as its number one value component. Without the control of any entity, Bitcoin is a truly democratised protocol that is absolutely closed to corruption, unlike many government backed schemes that exist, such as Quantitative Easing, which is essentially a way for governments to give free money to investment banks, i.e. their cronies, at the expense of taxpayers.\n",

Indeed, when the infamous web black market Silk Road was shut down, Bitcoin instantly decreased in value (wired.com).\n",
      "Level of recognition\n",
      "Bitcoin is recognised and is perfectly legal in a lot of countries, however some of the world’s governments still don’t have any regulations regarding BTC, while others have outright banned it.\n",

      "Volatility\n",
      "The price of Bitcoins has had its ups and downs, going through various cycles of skyrocketing and plummeting, referred to by some as bubbles and busts. Throughout its history BTC has been conquering new heights, only to sustain a massive drop straight after. Its value is unpredictable, it changes rapidly and drastically, which can cause significant financial damage to an imprudent investor.\n",
      "Continuous development\n",
      "The future of Bitcoin is rather unclear. Currently, governments and banks are not able to control BTC, it’s almost unregulated. However, the bigger and more popular it gets, the more world governments will try to take it under control. A regulated and governed Bitcoin would be an entirely different sort of currency.\n",

      "When bitcoin is viewed from an investment perspective, it is more often compared to gold than it is to other currencies. That is because bitcoin and gold have a lot in common as assets. Both are limited in supply, have functional use and are considered by many, despite their volatility, to be good stores of value.\n",
      "Investing on bitcoins is very attractive however ,there are lot of risks involved, let me break it down for you here .\n",
      "Despite Bitcoin’s impressive annualized returns since its inception in 2009, the reality is that the currency is still in its infancy and no one knows whether it will really become globally accepted or whether it will eventually disappear. This uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin’s future is reflected in its price volatility.\n",

      "If you would like to learn how to invest and trade financial markets, just check out this page here\n",
      "Regulatory Risk\n",
      "Probably the biggest risk to the future success of Bitcoin as both a currency and as an investment class is regulatory risk. If China, for example, decides to ban its citizens from holding bitcoin, the price of the digital currency would crash. China is by far the largest market for bitcoin trading, with over 90 percent of trading occurring in the People’s Republic. Hence, any negative regulatory changes would have a direct impact on the world’s bitcoin investment.\n",
      "The same goes for leading Bitcoin startup hubs like the U.S. and the U.K. Should any large economy ban Bitcoin the price will collapse and struggle to recover.\n",
      "Bitcoin Scalability\n",
      "Another risk to Bitcoin is the failure of the network’s participants to come to an agreement on how to handle scalability issues. For Bitcoin to succeed, the blockchain needs to be able to handle much higher transaction volumes than it is currently processing and it must be able to do so within a shorter period of time. Currently, Bitcoin transactions usually take 20 to 40 minutes, which is fantastic when making international money transfers but not so great when trying to pay for coffee.\n",
      "Ideas on how to scale Bitcoin have been presented by the Bitcoin Core development team and are currently under consideration for implementation. However, the vast majority of Bitcoin miners that support the blockchain need to agree with these changes before any significant implementation can be done. If no agreement is made, Bitcoin’s scalability challenges may lead to bitcoin struggling as a transactional currency in the long run.\n",

      "Today is a big day for me and everyone else who is investing in Bitcoin. Today one bitcoin exceeded the value of 7.000$. My parents, my colleagues, my friends told me not to invest. They told me that it’s a risk. Some said that bitcoin wasn’t going to reach 5.000$, while the most optimists said that it’s going to reach 5.000$ by the end of 2017! You know something. I didn’t give a f*ck what they said. All of their predictions were sh*t. And here it is! Bitcoin’s value today is over 7.000$ and it continues to increase. My capital is now over 3 times bigger than my starter one. And I didn’t buy bitcoins because I wanted to earn money or become rich. I bought bitcoins because I believed in the idea of bitcoin, I bought bitcoins because I understood the need of the society to solve its transaction problems. My difference with the ones who didn’t invest was that they didn’t believe in bitcoin. They’re the kind of people for whom it’s always the government’s fault, it’s always the system’s fault, it’s always somebody else’s fault. They’re the kind of people that when something is wrong, they’re going to raise their hand and point somebody else. They never say “Hey, It’s my fault, I need to understand what the f*ck is going wrong and fix this sh*t”. They’re the kind of people that consists of an investment in bitcoin as a risk but they do not consider their time -THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSET WE HAVE IN OUR LIVES- they’re spending for making somebody else rich as a risk. Ladies and gentlemen, I confirm to you that from my very little experience until now that the biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks!\n",

This way everyone does what they want to do and life becomes better for them.\n",

Bitcoin solves them and it’s still in the beginning. Don’t you believe me? Take a look around you. How many people invest in bitcoin? That’s a ridiculously small percentage of them doing it. So, why do you -people that have no idea about bitcoin and how it works- say to me that bitcoin is a dangerous investment when I make more money than you do and that’s not the big thing. The big thing is you think that your job is the safe way, the job for which you invest 8 hours per day to make somebody else rich, and you also believe that you love your job and you want to make your successful business and besides all that, when you go home after job, you have to count your money and see if it’s enough to pay your bills and your rent and YOU DO SH*T ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE FOR 3 HOURS. Should I listen to you? Get the f*ck out of here!\n",

Because the most of you, will choose to stay in your comfort zone and do nothing. Your fear beats you. But when everybody talks about bitcoin you will ask me to teach you and you will pay me! However, for those of you who will choose to take the risk, you’re unstoppable. Nobody can stop you from success. And you deserve this education for FREE!\n",

At the beginning of August, following a soft fork that saw bitcoin separate into two separate currencies (bitcoin and bitcoin cash), bitcoin's blockchain was upgraded. This upgrade moved some information off of bitcoin's blockchain in order to boost capacity and transaction settlement times, as well as reduce transaction fees, in an effort to attract enterprises.\n",
      "But what if bitcoin's blockchain fails to be a go-to option for businesses? Right now, more than 150 organizations are currently testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain, which supports smart contracts. These are protocols that help facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation of a contract, and they provide marked distinction from bitcoin's blockchain. If bitcoin's blockchain fails to differentiate itself and attract enterprises, bitcoin's price could suffer.\n",
      "2. Brand-name businesses stop accepting bitcoin\n",
      "Since 2014, a handful of brand-name businesses have accepted bitcoin as a form of payment, with smaller merchants latching on in recent years. Some investors view this growth in bitcoin's payment platform as a good reason to buy.\n",
      "However, it could also be a source of investor frustration. If bitcoin remains volatile (remember, it's had three declines of at least 29% in a very short period of time over the past five months), there's the real possibility that merchants could bow out of accepting the virtual currency. A potentially lengthy settlement period gives bitcoin time to move against the grain, which could mean converting bitcoin into a lot less cash than when a transaction was completed. If brand-name merchants bail on the virtual currency, bitcoin's price could tumble.\n",
      "3. A double-edged sword of regulation\n",
      "In some ways the regulatory environment for bitcoin has been a positive in 2017. Japan began accepting the currency as legal tender earlier this year, and the CME Group (NASDAQ: CME) -- operator of the world's biggest derivatives marketplace -- recently announced that it would begin carrying bitcoin futures by the end of the year. These moves help to validate bitcoin as an investment and a form of tender.\n",
      "Then again, the regulatory environment can also keep bitcoin out of lucrative markets. In September, both China and South Korea nixed initial coin offerings, with China going a step further and announcing the eventual closure of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. Increased regulation could either help or hinder bitcoin.\n",
      "4. A cyber attack hits Bitfinex (or another cryptocurrency exchange)\n",
      "Another critical risk for bitcoin -- and all cryptocurrencies, for that matter -- is the potential for a cyberattack. Four years ago, Mt. Gox, which was handling about 70% of bitcoin's trading volume at the time, was hit by a crippling cyberattack. In the bankruptcy filing from Mt. Gox just months later, it cited the theft of 850,000 bitcoin (worth $6.8 billion today) and cash. In the two years following this cyberattack, bitcoin wound up losing more than 80% of its value.\n",
      "Today, cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex handles around half of all trading volume for bitcoin. If it were to be hit with a cyber attack, it could destabilize the market and send bitcoin significantly lower.\n",
      "5. Margin mayhem derived from its CME listing\n",
      "The recent announcement that the CME Group would begin listing futures for bitcoin by year's end was viewed as a positive by many on Wall Street. The ability for Wall Street firms to take a stake in bitcoin, without having to dabble in decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, could introduce new money and reduce volatility.\n",
      "But there's another side to this story.\n",
      "Futures trading will allow Wall Street to bet against bitcoin for the first time ever. It will also allow all walks of investors to borrow on margin to enter those short positions. If bitcoin's value were to swing violently up or down, it could lead to a flood of margin calls that have the potential to destabilize the market for bitcoin. And because there's no precedent for an asset like bitcoin, setting the margin limits is nothing more than guesswork at this point.\n",
      "6. Investor emotions sack bitcoin\n",
      "Last but not least, investor sentiment, which has been a crucial catalyst of bitcoin's growth, could also push this virtual currency downward. Since bitcoin's inception, individual investors have controlled its value. Compared to Wall Street investment firms, retail investors are far more prone to allowing their emotions to influence their investing decisions -- which rarely ends well. Many of bitcoin's wild price swings owe to retail investors' piling into or bailing out of bitcoin based on the latest news. It wouldn't take much for investor sentiment to shift and send bitcoin's value plummeting.\n",

      "What drove the cryptocurrency market in 2017?\n",
      "From our point of view, the development and establishment of blockchain technology will be the main market drivers in 2017. The block chain and decentralised transaction systems based on it have the potential to change society and the economy in a sustainable way. In the meantime, blockchain technology is attracting increasing interest outside the world of Internet startups. Banks and the established FinTech economy, large companies and governments are interested in this. While Bitcoin mainly serves as a value vehicle, crypto ecosystems such as Ethereum and Cardano also benefit from this overarching trend. However, the success of these platforms, as well as of Bitcoin-Cash, also points to another fact: The Bitcoin Blockchain in its original form has come of age and is no longer able to meet users' requirements for speed and transaction volumes without compromising.\n",
      "At the same time, new user groups - such as companies from established industry - but also the supervisory authorities are also registering new requirements with regard to safety standards and the transparency of the block chain. Ethereum, Ripple and the newcomers Bitcoin Cash and Cardano can benefit from this. Bitcoin Cash's transaction system offers a more powerful block chain than Bitcoin Cash. Like Ethereum and the Ripple Labs, Cardano is in the process of laying the foundations for more complex blockchain business models. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance now includes more than 150 companies and other organizations to test the Blockchain in pilot projects.\n",
      "The low interest rate policy on the financial markets also contributes to the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies. With a little luck and wise investment strategies in this market segment, investors can expect extremely high returns. Anyone who has acquired Bitcoins at relatively low prices in recent years or even at the beginning of 2017 can today enjoy immense asset growth. Against the background of the Bitcoin story, smaller cryptocurrencies are also interesting for investors today. It remains to be seen whether the currently weak US dollar has also boosted the bitcoin hype, which - like various other cryptocurrencies or gold - is a finite resource with no relevant inflationary tendencies.\n",
      "What will 2018 bring to the cryptocurrency market?\n",
      "From the current perspective, it seems difficult to make a forecast on the further development of the cryptocurrency market. There are several factors in favour of a further upward trend:\n",
      "The unbroken interest of investors in crypto investments.\n",
      "Block chain technology, which has firmly established itself as one of the foundations for future digital transformation processes.\n",
      "The expected expansion of financial products on a cryptocurrency basis on conventional stock exchanges.\n",
      "However, countervailing market developments and external events can cancel out such positive expectations in a very short period of time. The price trends of crypto currencies can change within seconds. In addition, skeptical market observers have been talking about a crypto-currency bubble for some time now, which would cause immense asset destruction if it burst. Cryptocurrencies are and will remain a highly speculative investment option for which no security nets exist.\n",

      "Some people think Bitcoin is the future. Others think Bitcoin is a scam. One thing is for sure: there are a lot of people out there making a lot of noise. There were very, very smart people saying that Bitcoin would fail soon. This was a few years back.\n",
      "Just this past December (2017), we saw Bitcoin explode upwards. What was once a $1000 coin a year ago became a $19,000 coin. How did that happen? Is it all mainstream media, hype, late investors, people coming in with unrealistic expectations - a giant bubble ready to pop? For more details, check out a recent blog post I wrote on this topic (What is Bitcoin?)\n",
      "In order to answer a lot of these questions, its important to understand what Bitcoin is trying to accomplish. What is the purpose of these so-called cryptocurrencies?\n",
      "Well, at the very core, bitcoins were designed to be a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”. This is what the founder, Satoshi Nakamoto said in his 2009 paper detailing the currency. It’s a decentralized currency. No bank. No government. No higher up that controls the transactions. The transactions are public, and verified by the people.\n",
      "Ever heard of the term the Blockchain? That’s the public ledger I’m referring to. It validates bitcoin transactions and allows for Bitcoin Miners to come in. People with nice, beefy machines that are able to process algorithms to solve these puzzles in order to tell the blockchain what order to process on. And, you get paid in…you guessed it. More bitcoin.\n",
      "That’s how more bitcoin comes into the market. There’s a ceiling. You can’t keep getting more and more bitcoins forever. That’s why there’s a supply and demand. Basic economics.\n",
      "People currently value these things. There are two types of investors right now. Some trying to get in and make quick money. Get in and get out. Others believe in the value of Bitcoin and are holding onto the coin in hopes that the price jumps. Long-term investors. They believe this is the future.\n",
      "You might think, “The ship has sailed. It’s peaked.” Well guess what, people were saying that last year. And the year before. And the year before that. Some bullish investors think the coin may go up to $100,000 each, if its widely adopted. Others predict it to fall to $0. It’s hard to say.\n",
      "And that’s ok. If you don’t believe in Bitcoin (yes, there are other competing coins out there that you should research), then simply don’t invest. If you don’t know what you’re doing, trying to time the peaks and valleys of day trading can certainly cause you to lose money.\n",
      "Should you keep investing even now? These coins are so volatile, its a risky investment. Within a few days, the value of a coin can drop a few thousand dollars. Check out this one week in December.\n",
      "Like with any investment. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. It’s a good idea if you believe if it’s a good idea. Could there be a future with another coin? That’s very possible. Are there a bunch of crap coins out there that are just being used to pump and dump to make quick cash? Absolutely. It’s important to do your research. Don’t just blindly jump into any cryptocurrency, Bitcoin included.\n",

      "I am not going to tell you what you should do, I am going to tell you what I do, merely for entertainment purposes, not as investment advice.\n",
      "My approach to cryptocurrencies is similar to seed investing in startups. I create portfolio of 10 - 20 cryptos, and I expect most of them to fail. But hopefully one or two will become the next big thing, and make it all worthwhile. Also I am investing only money I am 100% ready to lose, in fact I regard all my money in cryptos as lost already. Any better outcome is just pleasant surprise.\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "First I have to strongly believe that whole industry (cryptocurrencies) is disruptive and is here to stay and take over. And that belief must come from understanding, not blind wishes. For that, some studying is necessary - I read BTC whitepaper and Whitepaper of every cryptocurrency from TOP 10 by market cap to develop a strong base knowledge of the industry. I ask questions on reddit, etc. I stay clear from spam Facebook groups full of hyped up people talking about random price fluctuations.\n",
      "Then I start researching cryptocurrency by cryptocurrency. I quickly skim through the webpage. If I do not understand the key value proposition of the cryptocurrency, I write it off. I like to understand what I am buying, and there is lot of bullshit out there, with very unclear (if any) value proposition (usually anything regarding social media is bullshit).\n",
      "If I understand and like the value proposition of a coin or token, I am going to see under which blockchain is it build. Most of them are build under Ethereum. So I ask myself - does it make sense to invest in this coin? Isn’t it better to invest directly into Ethereum? How are they correlated?\n",
      "If I see the coin is priced pretty low (comparing market cap), I might go directly for the coin. If it already went up couple of hundreds or thousands of %, I might as well invest directly into ETH.\n",
      "When I decide the price is right, I am going to dig deeper - reading whitepaper, reddit boards (sometimes you find pearls like this ). I ask some hard questions -Is it inflationary and how much? Is it valuable for this project to use blockchain? Most of the services could just as well use SQL database and it wouldn’t matter. I beware of same old business disguising itself as disruptive blockchain tech. There are plenty of them.\n",
      "I pay special attention to team - who are these guys? How experienced are they? Are they fully committed or is this just a sidekick project? Especially - who are developers and how many of them is there? If I see 7 founders, and only 1–2 are devs (the rest usually being “marketing, community management, finance, sales, visionary…”) I run away.\n",
      "If the coin passes all these filters, I am going to close my eyes and buy for couple of bucks. I always only buy for as much as I can lose. I am not going to daytrade, stare into charts or panic sell. I am going to let it lie for 1–5 years, occasionally watching and reading the news about project. I also set up some sell limit order for 1/3 - 1/2 of the investment for 300% - 600% to secure a profit and freeroll if it spikes suddenly (which happens a lot here), depends on the coin and my faith in it.\n",
      "If you made it here, I will reward you with one coin I like. Warning! I do not recommend anything to anyone, this purely me saying what I like. If I said I like jumping into volcano, you surely wouldn’t jump there.\n",

      "I like the team - people from Google, EY, etc. They seem like they are in for realz, and not just for quick scam bucks.\n",
      "I like the price - it still haven’t been pumped crazy high, like many other good coins, and the cap is pretty low too, so I hope there is room for big growth.\n",
      "I like the project roadmap - it says that there will be many releases throughout 2017, so it will grab more attention soon. Or it will be pretty clear it failed to deliver soon (no need to wait for 5 years with this one!)\n",
      "I like the fact it’s not traded on many exchanges - that means, it is still pretty undiscovered by many hype traders…and when it will be supported by more exchanges, the price can grow significantly.\n",

      "Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Which is a better option?\n",
      "Since its inception, Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency; however, experts are increasingly tipping its closest rival-Ethereum-to start challenging it for the top position this year. Marcus Vandea, the CEO of Playfold says “Ethereum could soon become the king of the blockchain world akin to what Google and Amazon are to cloud computing.” Marcus adds that “Bitcoin will be sacrificed for the sake of the other coins.” This is not entirely unexpected after Ethereum rose by more than 5000% in 2017 catapulted by the boom in ICOs.\n",
      "Although Ethereum is widely seen as the closest rival, the community behind Bitcoin’s younger sibling-Bitcoin Cash- said they had taken active measures to claim the first spot. Nevertheless, Roman Guelfi-Gibbs- the Lead Systems Designer and CEO of Pinnacle Brilliance Systems Inc- maintains that Bitcoin will soar even higher and eventually become a ‘secure’ store of value: “We know that the Bitcoin Cash crowd are vying for the title and have taken active measures to overtake BTC. We [also] know Lightning is coming with the promised upgrades in speed and transaction fees. For 2018, Bitcoin will remain king and it should be able to stave-off further attacks on its public standing. In the future, we may see BTC become like gold, as a secure store of value... But for now, Bitcoin is still king.”\n",
      "Some experts have also cited Bitcoin’s resilience and its proven demand as a significant driver for future growth. Raza Ahmed, the CTO of TriForce Tokens holds that “Bitcoin is considered the gold of the crypto-currency space. Although many speculate that Bitcoins days are over, time after time, it came back to surprise us with its rapid and rather dramatic increase in price. It’s not as simple as a yes or no question, what and why do you need it, is the better question. Bitcoin is still considered and will be for a while longer the leading crypto-currency due to its already established demand.”\n",
      "According to David Drake, Founder and Chairman of LDJ Capital, “We are likely to see Bitcoin becoming the best high-growth investment this year due to the growing adoption and increased accessibility.” The cryptocurrency investor and advisor claims that Bitcoin’s predictable deflationary monetary supply will trigger a positive response in price as demand increases.\n",
      "Despite the triple-digit returns posted by digital currencies last year, Dr. John Mathews, Bitnation CFO, insists extreme caution should be exercised when making an investment decision. Mathews cautioned that “You should invest in cryptocurrency if you understand why it is a revolutionary technology and what its implications might be. Before investing your money, invest some time to educate yourself so that you can make better decisions. Do not invest in it if you’re uncomfortable taking financial risks and cannot afford to lose your investment.”\n",
      "Similarly, some analysts have urged caution warning that investing in any cryptocurrency is a game that looks pretty much like a bubble owing to their extreme volatility. “People who invest in Bitcoin should do so to ride the wave. Investing a small amount to see where it goes. Right now it’s highly speculative, but if it eventually gains more utility, things can get more interesting, indeed,” asserts Tammy Leigh Kahn, the COO of ClearCoin.\n",
      "It is also important to note that Bitcoin and Ethereum are relatively distinct. Whereas Bitcoin is more of a digital gold and a medium of payment, Ethereum has a few nifty features that give it an edge over its predecessor in some key areas.\n",

      "You can start bitcoin mining here(This is a robust site with no ads. Though to make a decent amount you have to be PATIENT, as the rate is slow).\n",
      "Explanation of Process-I'll simplify the process to illustrate the idea, which is quite simple - at any given time, ask everyone to independently try to solve a hard (for the computer) computational puzzle. Solving the puzzle awards you the right to add any correct new transactions to a public database (the blockchain, see below for an explanation). The lucky solver receives a fixed bounty of new bitcoins that were created just now ('mined'), as well as whatever fees that were included with the transactions.\n",
      "To be a bit more specific - when a miner solves the puzzle, it broadcasts the solution to all other miners. Every miner that sees a correct solution accepts it, because they'd rather admit defeat in this round and move quickly to the next - where they might solve the puzzle.\n",
      "To be clear, a correct solution is a package of verified new transactions and the solution to the puzzle. This package is called a block and is appended to the end of the chain of previous blocks (=blockchain). If even one of the transactions in the new block has been wrongly validated, then the miners would not accept the solution.\n",
      "The bottom line - you have a group you don't trust individually, but by using a clever process called mining, or more commonly known as Proof-of-Work, you can get them to process and verify transactions much like a bank.\n",

      "Bitcoin can be used to buy things electronically. In that sense, it’s like conventional dollars, euros, or yen, which are also traded digitally.\n",
      "However, bitcoin’s most important characteristic, and the thing that makes it different to conventional money, is that it is decentralized. No single institution controls the bitcoin network. This puts some people at ease, because it means that a large bank can’t control their money.\n",

      "The difference between Bitcoin and other money systems such as the US dollar or Euro is that the supply of Bitcoin is governed by a set of rules that is agreed upon by a large, distributed group of people (strangers for the most part), rather than a central bank. The set of rules were defined at Bitcoin’s inception in a whitepaper authored by someone or a group of people named Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",

      "We’re sitting on a park bench. It’s a great day.\n",
      "I have one apple with me. I give it to you.\n",
      "You now have one apple and I have zero.\n",
      "That was simple, right?\n",
      "Let’s look closely at what happened:\n",
      "My apple was physically put into your hand.\n",
      "You know it happened. I was there. You were there. You touched it.\n",
      "We didn’t need a third person there to help us make the transfer. We didn’t need to pull in Uncle Tommy (who’s a famous judge) to sit with us on the bench and confirm that the apple went from me to you.\n",
      "The apple’s yours! I can’t give you another apple because I don’t have any left. I can’t control it anymore. The apple left my possession completely. You have full control over that apple now. You can give it to your friend if you want, and then that friend can give it to his friend. And so on.\n",
      "So that’s what an in-person exchange looks like. I guess it’s really the same, whether I’m giving you a banana, a book, or say a quarter, or a dollar bill….\n",
      "But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n",
      "Back to apples!\n",
      "Now say, I have one digital apple. Here, I’ll give you my digital apple.\n",
      "Ah! Now it gets interesting.\n",
      "How do you know that that digital apple that used to be mine, is now yours, and only yours? Think about it for a second.\n",
      "It’s more complicated, right? How do you know that I didn’t send that apple to Uncle Tommy as an email attachment first? Or your friend Joe? Or my friend Lisa too?\n",
      "Maybe I made a couple of copies of that digital apple on my computer. Maybe I put it up on the internet and one million people downloaded it.\n",
      "As you see, this digital exchange is a bit of a problem. Sending digital apples doesn’t look like sending physical apples.\n",
      "Some brainy computer scientists actually have a name for this problem: it’s called the double-spending problem. But don’t worry about it. All you need to know is that, it’s confused them for quite some time and they’ve never solved it.\n",
      "Until now.\n",
      "But let’s try to think of a solution on our own.\n",
      "Ledgers\n",
      "Maybe these digital apples need to be tracked in a ledger. It’s basically a book where you track all transactions — an accounting book.\n",
      "This ledger, since it’s digital, needs to live in its own world and have someone in charge of it.\n",
      "Say, just like World of Warcraft. Blizzard, the guys who created the online game, have a “digital ledger” of all the rare flaming fire swords that exist in their system. So, cool, someone like them could keep track of our digital apples. Awesome — we solved it!\n",
      "Problems\n",
      "There’s a bit of a problem though:\n",
      "1) What if some guy over at Blizzard created more? He could just add a couple of digital apples to his balance whenever he wants!\n",
      "2) It’s not exactly like when we were on the bench that one day. It was just you and me then. Going through Blizzard is like pulling in Uncle Tommy(a third-party) out of court(did I mention he’s a famous judge?) for all our park bench transactions. How can I just hand over my digital apple to you, like, you know— the usual way?\n",
      "Is there any way to closely replicate our park bench, just you-and-me, transaction digitally? Seems kinda tough…\n",
      "The Solution\n",
      "What if we gave this ledger — to everybody? Instead of the ledger living on a Blizzard computer, it’ll live in everybody’s computers. All the transactions that have ever happened, from all time, in digital apples will be recorded in it.\n",
      "You can’t cheat it. I can’t send you digital apples I don’t have, because then it wouldn’t sync up with everybody in the system. It’d be a tough system to beat. Especially if it got really big.\n",
      "Plus it’s not controlled by one person, so I know there’s no one that can just decide to give himself more digital apples. The rules of the system were already defined at the beginning. And the code and rules are open-source. It’s there for the smart people to contribute to, maintain, secure, improve on, and check on.\n",
      "You could participate in this network too and update the ledger and make sure it all checks out. For the trouble, you could get like 25 digital apples as a reward. In fact, that’s the only way to create more digital apples in the system.\n",
      "I simplified quite a bit\n",
      "…but that system I explained exists. It’s called the Bitcoin protocol. And those digital apples are the “bitcoins” within the system. Fancy!\n",
      "So, did you see what happened? What does the public ledger enable?\n",
      "1) It’s open source remember? The total number of apples was defined in the public ledger at the beginning. I know the exact amount that exists. Within the system, I know they are limited(scarce).\n",
      "2) When I make an exchange I now know that digital apple certifiably left my possession and is now completely yours. I used to not be able to say that about digital things. It will be updated and verified by the public ledger.\n",
      "3) Because it’s a public ledger, I didn’t need Uncle Tommy(third-party) to make sure I didn’t cheat, or make extra copies for myself, or send apples twice, or thrice…\n",
      "Within the system, the exchange of a digital apple is now just like the exchange of a physical one. It’s now as good as seeing a physical apple leave my hand and drop into your pocket. And just like on the park bench, the exchange involved two people only. You and me — we didn’t need Uncle Tommy there to make it valid.\n",
      "In other words, it behaves like a physical object.\n",
      "But you know what’s cool? It’s still digital. We can now deal with 1,000 apples,or 1 million apples, or even .0000001 apples. I can send it with a click of a button, and I can still drop it in your digital pocket if I was in Nicaragua and you were all the way in New York.\n",
      "I can even make other digital things ride on top of these digital apples! It’s digital after-all. Maybe I can attach some text on it — a digital note. Or maybe I can attach more important things; like say a contract, or a stock certificate, or an ID card…\n",
      "So this is great! How should we treat or value these “digital apples”? They’re quite useful aren’t they?\n",
      "Well, a lot of people are arguing over it now. There’s debate between this and that economic school. Between politicians. Between programmers. Don’t listen to all of them though. Some people are smart. Some are misinformed. Some say the system is worth a lot, some say it’s actually worth zero. Some guy actually put a hard number: $1,300 per apple. Some say it’s digital gold, some a currency. Other say they’re just like tulips. Some people say it’ll change the world, some say it’s just a fad.\n",
      "I have my own opinion about it.\n",
      "That’s a story for another time though. But kid, you now know more about Bitcoin than most.\n",

      "Not really - below is as close as I can get for now. Explanations in italics.\n",
      "Bitcoin is like gold you can’t see. (Some are pushing to have Bitcoin be perceived as digital gold and a store of value. It’s just a store of speculation right now. Bitcoin's price has gone down 50% in a day and 70% in 6 weeks. Aleo, 9 years in, Bitcoin is not really being used as p2p ecash.

      "I will try to explain the whole thing in a very simple way. It might be a long explanation but will try to keep it as simple as possible. Let’s start.\n",
      "Bitcoin network is designed in such a way that it caps the amount of information on its network, meaning the information in each block in blockchain. This was proposed initially to protect it from cyber attacks. Hence, there is a restricted amount of transactions it can process which we call as Block Size Limit.\n",
      "Note: For those who don’t understand, what block size and blockchain is, you can think it as an infinitely long library with infinite number of fixed size shelves (that can hold say 50 books) arranged in a row. Here,\n",
      "Each Shelf = Block\n",
      "Shelf Size i.e. 50 books = Block Size\n",
      "Shelves arranged in a row = Blockchain, I hope this clarifies the concept of Blockchain.\n",
      "Now, as Bitcoin is gaining more and more popularity, the number of transaction are increasing at a very high rate which results in high transaction time and processing fees. Hence, the efficiency of system has reduced.\n",
      "To address this issue, a lot of proposals were given (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals - BIP) by two different groups:\n",
      "Group of Miners - Miners are the one who deploy costly equipment or super computers to verify transactions. They form the base infrastructure of bitcoin network. As per miners, the block size limit should be increased and this will reduce the network congestion.\n",
      "Core Developers - The core developers aim at providing error-free bitcoin network. They propose to move out some of the data from block. As per them, this change will not only reduce the network congestion but will also allow a new feature in bitcoin i.e. smart contracts (meaning, apps or contracts that can be built over bitcoin). This proposal is called SegWit.\n",
      "Now, both the groups have their own motives to achieve like core developers want to keep network secure from cyber attacks and also maintain the basic features of Bitcoin like 1 MB block size. On the other hand, miners have invested millions of dollars in the mining equipment and moving data off the blockchain (as suggested by core developers ) effectively diminishes the influence of miners.\n",
      "Hence, Segwit (a better proposal - what I think) is getting a lot of resistance from miners, majorly from BITMAIN which has around 20%-30% of mining share in bitcoin network.\n",
      "With all these discussion and proposal, both the groups finally agreed on a mutual decision which is called SegWit2x, which implements SegWit and increase the block size limit form 1 MB to 2 MB.\n",
      "The new software (Segwit2x) will be released to miners on 21st July and around 80–85% miners are willing to run the same.\n",
      "From , 21st July to 31st July, the bitcoin community will monitor how many miners deploy SegWit2x. If more than 80% deploy it consistently, then whole community will accept the same and the split of bitcoin will be avoided, at least for some time.\n",
      "BUT, if a majority do not deploy the software by 31st July then a User Activated Soft Fork will happen. (For the readers who don’t understand soft fork - Soft fork is like adding a new feature to say, whatsapp. For Example - Adding a video calling feature in whatsapp)\n",
      "On 1st August - If the above happens then, UASF will be deployed and developers/supporters will start checking if the bitcoin transactions are compliant with SegWit. If this works, then two versions of bitcoin’s blockchain could come into existence.\n",
      "This will lead to massive volatility in the price.\n",

      "Before talking about Bitcoins, lets talk about Money.\n",
      "What is money? literally ?\n",
      "Money is the representation of worth or value that we are holding, using a medium or an instrument provided by any central authority or any trusted third party.\n",
      "In our case these guys are Reserve Bank of India or PayTM or any financial institutions. So when you hold a RS 2000 note, you are holding a piece of representation made by RBI equivalent to worth of RS 2000/-\n",
      "These financial instruments have some common features too,\n",
      "Nobody in the world can have exactly the same note as you are having, and when you transfer or give it to someone , you loose it.You cannot hold it and give it to some one like in the case of a digital media file. You can just copy a file and share to someone. But not money.\n",

After the first equation the following equations processed that find the same answer are recognized with finding what is called an uncle. The equations result in a previous determined answer being send back as a positive result that then allows for the expansion of the chain and the processors to then work on the next block and continue hashing and expanding the blockchain they are using their power for.

Every transaction in Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment done by the network, same is true for issuance of new bitcoins too, there is no central governance involved. And that’s key, there is no central governance at a transaction and issuance level. In contrast, a conventional currency is issued by a central authority which maintains all associated records. Not just that, the central authority can and does regulate the usage of currency. Conventional currency, in the cryptocurrency circles, is also called fiat currency or simply fiat F-I-A-T.\n",

      "In order to understand a “bubble” one needs to understand the underlying valuation metrics. Most “experts” simply guess at how to value Bitcoin and subsequently explain the price movements very poorly. Tom Lee of Fundstrat (formerly head of research at J.p. Morgan) has come up with a method using Metcalfe’s Law, which says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users, and explained 94% of Bitcoin’s price movements over the last 4 years.\n",
      "TOP STRATEGIST: Bitcoin will soar to $25,000 in 5 years\n",
      "The fundamental takeaway here is that Bitcoin as a network of users has achieved a significant enough size that its valuation fluctuates largely based on a function related to average transaction value and number of users. Given an upward trending average transaction size and an upward trending number of users you can see how the price could continuously increase without any particular “bursting” of a bubble. The two major factors that could burst Bitcoin would be a significant movement of users to another network and a significant change in the transaction values.\n",
      "Understanding these two things gives you a sense of how crypto works as a larger market and helps you understand that cryptocurrency generally is just a new medium for storing value and these various stores of value have always been around and various games have been played with those stores of value to incentivize players towards certain economic outcomes. Thinking that it is a “bubble” is simply to miss the point (and the boat) completely.\n",
      "Generally speaking crypto advantages fall into a few categories: 1) deflationary economics. This means that supply can never be manipulated so that your store of value will incentivize users into moving capital to beat inflation. This generally creates an arbitrage scenario with nearly all fiat currencies that incentivized growth in storing of value in crypto over banks and through other fiat denominated institutions. When you anticipate needing fiat funds you will simply draw from the percentage of your portfolio that is fiat currency and rebalance as the overall crypto percentage grows and you need to rebalance for risk purposes. 2) i’m not going to finish this section because it will get tedious.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency represents a fundamental shift in how people store value. To think that Bitcoin is a “bubble” is to ignore the fundamental reality of the last 8 years. Out of all world “currencies” Bitcoin has been the best performing for 7 of those 8 years. This is unlikely to change except a different crypto could take the place of Bitcoin which is why a good investor will balance their portfolio with a mix of at least Litecoin, Monero, Dash, and Bitcoin Cash in addition to Bitcoin, real estate, stocks, cash, and maybe some bonds if you know how to play that game.\n",

      "Over the past 12 months, the price of a Bitcoin has surged tremendously. Back in January 2017, the price of 1 BTC was about $700 — roughly the cost of a flagship iPhone. Come December 2017, it almost scaled up to $18,000 — the cost of 18 iPhone Xs. And you would be surprised to know that the price was just around $2500 in August 2017.\n",

      "- You.\n",
      "Well, there were several instances from a technical perspective — like the forking, amongst a few. But mostly, people were fascinated about the idea that they could become millionaires in a quick span of time. The internet was filled with tons of articles about how people became multi millionaires after investing a few hundred dollars a few years back, and everyone wanted to join in. Make hay while the sun shines, they said.\n",
      "The media took pride in reporting these frenzies, since they gave the people what they wanted to hear. “Become a millionaire” has been the tagline everywhere. They glorified the ones who made merry, which inspired a whole lot of people. It was practically adding more fuel to the fire.\n",
      "The result? It exploded! More and more people wanted Bitcoins. Countless new cryptocurrency exchanges (a few fraudulent ones, albeit) took birth, and amassed a ridiculous number of users and revenue in quick time. “How many Bitcoins do you own?” has become a common expression in today’s world. You often come across stories of success, regret, hope, and failures in this domain. The market has become so intensive — only a topic related to religion or the American President’s impeachment could go head on in terms of TRPs. The Bitcoin market has witnessed a chatter and excitement that not even the traditional bull market has been able to achieve in the past 400 years since its inception.\n",

      "Okay, calm down. I’ll get to the point.\n",
      "The fundamental idea of Bitcoin was to be a digital currency that made sure transferring money was cheap. Back in January, the average fee for a Bitcoin transfer from one wallet to another, for a block size of 250 bytes was less than a dollar. Sounds cheap. For the price of a coffee, the transaction happened almost instantanously, which showed great potential in real world applications.\n",
      "Fast forward to December 2017 — the average price of a transfer of the same size is almost 0.001 BTC. That’s almost $18, considering 1BTC =$18,000.\n",
      "I’ll share an example. I held some value of BTC in an Indian exchange. For transferring the coin to another exchange where I wanted to buy another cryptocurrency, the transfer fee was 0.001BTC. For the transfer fee itself, I could have purchased some 100 odd coins. In addition to it, a 0.25% fee for the purchase from the exchange was levied, which further increased my cost. It was ridiculous, but I ended up doing it anyway. I had no choice.\n",
      "I’ll admit, the transfer fee is not expensive enough to change the market cap of Bitcoin today. However, considering the rate at which it is growing — breaking multiple records and helping make a lot of new additions into the Forbes Billionaires list, the transfer fee is going to get out of bounds. The price of a Bitcoin is obviously going to increase in the days to come, and could potentially triple or quadruple over its current value. It is a strong possibility. But, the transfer fee is also going to grow proportionately, which is a massive sign of worry.\n",
      "We still do not understand this, Ajay. How is this going to bring such a flagship currency down?\n",
      "- You.\n",
      "I saw this coming. The simple answer is — this problem is going against the very idea for which Bitcoins were formed — to be a digital payment system on its own. For a system to work, there has be a lot of people using it. When the price goes up, the usability goes down, and I sense a lot of people not using Bitcoins for payments. And since a lot of investments today are small amounts — probably to the tune of several hundred dollars, it is very much evident that the new age investors fall in the middle to upper middle class segment. Those are the very people who are going to stay away from using BTC for settlements and purchases.\n",
      "Bitcoin would then defeat the whole purpose as to why it was made. With the emergence of the so called ‘Altcoins’ who are doing a much better job — both transaction and block size wise, people are going to have alternatives. When there are good alternatives, the OG doesn’t matter. It would just become vintage. Useless. Like a Nokia 3310 in 2015. Served the purpose well in it’s prime, now redundant.\n",

      "God. You have scared us to the wits. Should we be really investing in Bitcoins?\n",
      "- You.\n",
      "Relax. Don’t be scared. Every investment is a risk, and this is just like any other. Mark Cuban had a good way to put this — if you are dependent on the money, then don’t invest. If you can invest, forget, and have the bandwidth to take the loss, go for it.\n",
      "I’m not saying this with a stamp of authority as to how things will pan out. There could be several technical changes to the Bitcoin blockchain that could possibly bring down the transaction costs. Or, there could be a new solution to this problem, that makes more and more people use this. Maybe a country would use it as their daily driver for microfinance.\n",
      "But from today’s perspective, things look skeptical for me. I’d say — look out for other cryptocurrencies that solve this problem while having the roadmap for a great application. It would be something that could yield you amazing returns in 3–4 years, probably in the tunes of thousands of percentages.\n",
      "A good way to do so would be to get yourself involved in a detailed study and research. I do that all the time, and I never find myself in trouble. It is a wise thing to do. The internet is bigger than it was ever before, and is available readily at your disposal. Use wisely.\n",

      "Bitcoin is a digital currency, also known as a cryptocurrency, that emerged after the financial crisis and is not underpinned by a central bank. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods for goods and services – an idea that has evidently caught the imagination of some investors, because its price has surged by more than 900% in 2017. Bitcoin – created by “miners” who use high-powered computers to solve complex mathematical problems – must be stored online using a digital wallet, and can be bought or sold using exchanges such as Bitstamp, Bithumb and Kraken.\n",
      "But as bitcoin hits the stratosphere, there are fears an economic bubble is forming as it becomes treated less like a currency and more like a store of value, open for speculators making ever increasing bets on how far it can rise. Central bankers, who had to step in when the subprime mortgage bubble burst, have also warned of its dangers.\n",
      "Economists have compared bitcoin’s meteoric rise with past bubbles, such as the tulip mania of the 17th century and the dotcom bubble that began in the late 90s with the Nasdaq index in New York and burst in 2000. Both examples foreshadow a painful collapse for a currency that has no intrinsic value to those who hold it beyond that ascribed to it by a community of owners. Should they realise the emperor has no clothes en masse, there could be a rude awakening.\n",
      "Oliver White at Fathom Financial Consulting wrote that bitcoin “certainly fits the criterion” for a bubble asset. Using data stretching back to 2013, Fathom’s economists compared the price of bitcoin with its historical average and plotted that against other mainstream assets - such as shares and bonds. They found the current value of bitcoin running at six times its average price since 2013. The cryptocurrency has yo-yoed with extreme volatility over the period – over the past week, the price has leapt to as high as $11,379 and plunged to $9,146 before rebounding to $10,700.\n",
      "Bitcoin disciples argue its price will rise further, viewing volatility as a necessary bump on the path to even higher valuations. Fans even coined a term to describe their tactic of holding on for dear life – Hodl. A deliberate mistyped neologism - up there with noob, to mean newbie – adding to the pantheon of computer slang.\n",

      "Summary\n",
      "Bitcoin works more like a digital store of value than a digital currency or a financial asset.\n",
      "This means that trying to estimate an intrinsic value for Bitcoin is pointless, and prices fluctuate according to demand trends as opposed to fundamental value.\n",
      "When making buy or sell decisions in Bitcoin, a quantitative trend following system could be a smart way to maximize the risk and return equation.\n",
      "“Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.\n",

      "An economic bubble or asset bubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value.\n",

      "THE DEFINITION OF MONEY? WHAT QUALIFIES AS MONEY ? WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MONEY? WHAT ARE THE FUNCTIONS OF MONEY?\n",
      "three functions of money:\n",
      "First: Money is a store of value. If I work today and earn 25 dollars, I can hold on to the money before I spend it because it will hold its value until tomorrow, next week, or even next year. In fact, holding money is a more effective way of storing value than holding other items of value such as corn, which might rot.\n",
      "Second: Money is a unit of account. You can think of money as a yardstick-the device we use to measure value in economic transactions. If you are shopping for a new computer, the price could be quoted in terms of t-shirts, bicycles, or corn. So, for instance, your new computer might cost you 100 to 150 bushels of corn at today's prices, but you would find it most helpful if the price were set in terms of money because it is a common measure of value across the economy.\n",
      "Third: Money is a medium of exchange. This means that money is widely accepted as a method of payment. When I go to the grocery store, I am confident that the cashier will accept my payment of money. In fact, U.S. paper money carries this statement: \"This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.\" This means that the U.S. government protects my right to pay with U.S. dollars.\n",

      "Not with Bitcoin. First it reached $1000 in 2003, then the cryptocurrency markets developed and showed how the ideas behind Bitcoin could be used for more than just payments.\n",

You see the older technologies of electricity, automobiles, telephones and airplane gradually become highly adopted in the US over decades of time. TV is different. It was on the scene for 20 years before they became affordable to just about everyone. Then the usage streaks to a high level very quickly. Notice the shape of that line. The line is the same with PC, Mobile phone and Internet. Those vertical lines represent massive support for a new technology executed in increasingly shorter intervals of time. The internet and social media make the awareness and adoption of new technology faster and faster. Bitcoin and Blockchain adoption would look the same—only faster yet.\n",
      "Blockchain is a new technology. And, like it or not, is irreversibly linked to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a hybrid of technology and money that Wall Street has never seen before. No one has. You cannot apply your strict financial definitions and predictabilities to Bitcoin nor can you call all of these technologies in the last graph ‘bubbles’ just because of the steep line of their acceptance and use by the masses. That is a line that Apple, Facebook and Amazon WANT to see. It is the ‘steep line of success’.\n",
      "So Bitcoin has one foot in the Tech circle and one in the Financial circle. Therefore, it cannot be strictly defined by the absolute parameters of either isolated circle and cannot be expected to act in a manner strictly predicted by either nor can all those charts and graphs pin it to a predicted outcome. Those definitions will eventually become known as this evolves but they are not known now.\n",
      "I personally think Bitcoin has more weight in the Tech circle and that steep line is definitely NOT a true bubble. Bitcoin is a driving juggernaut that cannot be stopped and it is dragging decentralized non-inflationary currency, blockchain technology, Tangle technology, transparency and accountability kicking and screaming along with it whether Wall Street likes and understands it or not.\n",
      "So I think it may be difficult to exactly call this one now as we will only know the truth after the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you how things are going. I’m involved in mining. We had a drop in bitcoin over the past two days. It hit quite a few cryptocurrencies, but it also flushed out quite a few scam currencies — people who are buying into them like gamblers have lost a lot of money in.\n",
      "My one and only partner has been showing his understanding of blockchain technology over the past two days. Bitcoin is something you want to look at as more of an indicator that indicates how all of the other currencies are doing. So if it drops, it means all of the other ones have fallen too most likely. South Korea was behind the latest drop, but anyway without going into crazy detail the effect of a decline in Bitcoin results in blockchain tech scammers getting exposed that are trying to creep up from the bottom of the earnings. Drops like this are a good thing. STOP acting like Bitcoin is gold or some kind of investment that you can gamble on. The same goes for the other cryptos. They are forms of tech that you can research and look into and ask corporations who are implementing them what is promising on the horizon.\n",
      "What my genius partner does is that when things drop, he’s keeping an eye on what is called dapps, which is just the word app with a ‘d’ tagged on the front. And apps are applications as in computer software applications. So dapps are applications written for blockchain technology. And there are all of these companies out there writing new blockchain apps that are better than the existing ones. And as corporate, scientific, and educational R&D departments discover these new dapps, they try them out to see if they are better than the ones they are using. If they are, they start jumping on board and using them to process their research over the blockchain network.\n",
      "See, crypto gets it value because it is a tech being used to perform work. Bitcoin’s work is recording transactions. Ethereum based crypto is being used to deliver scientific, marketing, and design research. Fortune 500 companies are using this instead of renting supercomputers. Pull your heads out of your rears and stop going to Wall Street to buy into this stuff. Those people are mostly idiots who just want to take their cut out of your “investment” in the form of fees. If your Wall Street rep can’t discuss dapps with you, run away!!!!!!!\n",
      "So what my genius partner has gotten beyond awesome at is watching these lists of dapps and seeing which ones are taking off and swapping them into his mining app setup for the dapps that are underperforming. He looks directly at the tech companies writing these dapps and figures out whether these companies writing these dapps are scams or legit. It’s easy to see because you can go to Microsoft and DuPont and universities and ask if they are actually using the dapp that these app writers claim they are buying into.\n",
      "So, my genius partner only services a certain number of dapps on his “supercomputer” mining machine, and as he finds ones that are performing better, he drops his poorest performer and puts in the new one to see if it ears us more returns.\n",
      "Quick note: mining machines are up to 40x cheaper to use than traditional supercomputers. That is why companies are flocking to blockchain. IT ISN’T MAGIC! IT ISN’T INSIDER TRADING!!! PULL YOUR HEADS OUT OF YOUR BUTTS AND DO SOME RESEARCH!!!!\n",
      "How do you do research? Install NiceHash on a computer and pretend you are a miner. It is foolish for you to get into mining if you are a corporation because it is impossible IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE for you to compete with small operations like my genius friend. These companies that sell hosted mining are scams!!!! DO NOT SUPPORT THEM. THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!\n",
      "But learn how mining works. Learn how dapps work with your little test miner. And you will start to see which techs are performing based on the stats that NiceHash makes available. Then buy the tokens and coins that they are selling. Those are the good ones.\n",
      "Because my genius partner is so good at this, our earning took a dip over the past two days thanks to idiots in the Korean Government… their 1%, but my pro has managed to keep us from bottoming out, and our numbers are back up today almost to where they were before South Korea messed up their crypto market by trying to regulate it. We are back up because my pro spends 100% of his awake time looking for optimizations to keep us on track to hit our return on investment for our mining equipment.\n",
      "HUGE WARNING!!!! DO NOT GET INTO MINING IF YOU ARE NOT A COMPUTER EXPERT. DO NOT JOIN A COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUILD MINING MACHINES IF YOU ARE A COMPUTER EXPERT. BUILD YOUR OWN. YOU WILL MAKE MORE MONEY, AND YOU WILL MAKE THE WORLD BETTER!!!!\n",
      "If you are not an expert, but you have a close friend or loved one who is, and they really want to be a miner, and they start getting into it, and they have proven they are good at it…. THEN begin investing in their computer. Set up a “company” between you and your fellow investors, give this person your money to buy equipment. Divide up the company based on investor inputs. Payout to members based on investment. Pay your friend a % of returns that he/she sets. Then leave your friend alone 100% of the time and let them focus on making your mining machine and keeping as optimal as possible. Helping them by providing them security and a place to build and a place that is easy to cool and a place that has a high power supply that is as cheap as possible, and you will have the best investment there is for your cryptocurrency interest. Otherwise, you need to think of your purchases of crypto as gambling on the same level as horseracing, and when you lose your money, it is your fault for wasting it at the track.\n",

      "THERE IS NEVER A BAD TIME TO BUY BITCOIN\n",
      "People who have missed out on the early days of Bitcoin may find it hard to justify investing at this point in time. That is understandable, as over $10,000 per Bitcoin is quite a steep price. The best time to invest in Bitcoin was yesterday. One should not contemplate whether or not to invest for too long. Opportunities will come and go with Bitcoin. Even if you would buy today and the value dropped by 20% overnight, there is still a good chance one will score a profit by just holding onto this Bitcoin balance for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "If you have done your own research into Bitcoin and think it might be worth trying, there are few reasons to wait. It is important to keep in mind one does not necessarily need to buy a full Bitcoin either. Unlike most other currencies in the world, Bitcoin can be divided up to eight digits after the decimal. Even purchasing a fractional amount of a Bitcoin is a smart idea right now, as it will most likely appreciate in value if you have some patience.\n",
      "I also have a video on this current market situation whether you should hold bits or buy alts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lets assume Indian Government bans Bitcoins in India. Bitcoin is illegal to use and traders and merchants cannot use Bitcoins for trades. Outside Bitcoin is still has value. Countries like Japan and Australia has already legalised Bitcoin. These are the few things that will happen:\n",
      "People will start doing Hawala via Bitcoin\n",
      "An underground market will develop with Bitcoin as currency. People will pay for all sorts of stuff with Bitcoins.\n",
      "Government will not be able to track Bitcoin transactions, they will lose on taxes\n",
      "Bribes will increase in Bitcoin. As Government does not recognise people will start paying bribes in Bitcoins\n",
      "People who want to transfer their funds from India, will convert their wealth in Bitcoins and move to another country\n",
      "India will lose to a global phenomenon\n",
      "Bitcoin is not something that will stop. It will flourish with or without government’s support. After demonetisation, old notes were being traded at 80% of their value. Value comes from the perception and if people find value in Bitcoins, people will trade in Bitcoins.\n",
      "If Indian Government accepts Bitcoins and make it legal, it will be a huge push to the global digital currency. Countries like India and China are reserved by default. Acceptance in these countries would mean that Bitcoins have reached a trust stage where conservatives believe Bitcoin has some value. This would be phenomenal. There would be mass adoption. I would expect a huge increase in price post this event.\n",

      "Cryptocurrency technology, Blockchain, needs to evolve to become the powerful and flexible tool it wants to be. Ethereum begins along this path by embracing the approach known as sharding, which has great potentials but also unanswered questions.\n",
      "With Sharding we mean a change to the operation of Ethereum, and blockchain in general. Thanks to this, each user can only approve specific instruction sets and transfers of Ether between certain nodes. This way, the single user does not have to approve all transactions each time, the system becomes more efficient and the performance improves.\n",
      "\"Performance\" in this context means in particular the speed of transactions. It's a \"problem\" common to all the most famous cryptocurrency, and has recently been at the center of a big change even in Bitcoin. The point is this: every computer in the blockchain is a node, that is, a machine that downloads all the blockchain (about 120 GB in the case of BTC) and undertakes to confirm the transactions.\n",
      "It can be seen that the system gets slower, so that in the case of Bitcoin it may take even days - a sluggish one that among other things prevents some financial operations that need speed. In addition, the commissions paid to miners (to confirm transactions) become too high, almost unbearable.\n",
      "To introduce a simpler comparison term, you may think that the Visa circuit processes approximately 40,000 transactions per second, while BTC and ETH blockchains, respectively, 3-7 and 7-15 transactions per second (units, not thousands). At the moment it is not even far-fetched to realize a decentralized Facebook or decentralized YouTube that has the same number of functionalities, active users, and storage as \"centralized counterparts\". The goal, however, is to implement such applications.\n",

      "Coming to the usability. It's frustrating to use the app. First you're expected to add the money in your account. Here you are not provided with a normal flow of adding money. Instead a virtual account is created to which money has to be added via IMPS, RGTS. From most of the banks it's impossible to transfer money to such virtual accounts which is created in an most customer unfriendly alphanumeric way.\n",
      "Their customer care executives are worst than roadside goons. First of all they are of the opinion that everyone in India should speak Hindi. They are the “Hindi is our national language” illusionists. They're dealing with a global cryptocurrency, atleast they should have the common sense to employ enough number of English speaking representatives.\n",
      "One particular instance where I was not able to add the money to their so-called Wallet. I checked with my bank (Citibank, a global bank which has all possible advanced transfer methods and facilities) and called them back saying that this way I'm not able to add the money. But the representative with whom I spoke earlier told that many of Citibank customers are able to transfer. This new Hindi speaking representative is asking for proof of such a conversation and accused me of lying for no reason instead of try and resolving my concern.\n",
      "The whole process of creating an account and trying for gazillion times to add money and buy bitcoins took me a week. Result? ZERO Bitcoins. All I got was irresponsible answers and confusing procedures. Rude Hindi representatives will add to your frustration. Do not opt for Zebpay. You will simply waste your time.\n",

      "Bitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions or blockchain. This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place.Bitcoin nodes use the block chain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.The primary purpose of mining is to allow Bitcoin nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus. Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce Bitcoins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a \"subsidy\" of newly created coins.\n",

Look through some altcoins you believe in, and if they've crashed harder than Bitcoin, consider buying some of them with your Bitcoin. Although the fiat value of Bitcoin may be lower, you might be able to get a good deal on some altcoins.\n",

For example reinvesting on cloud mining websites, buying items online, etc. As the fiat value of your Bitcoin is lower during a crash you you'll have less buying power, so the best bet is to either cash out if you can't risk further losses, or to 'HODL' until its value goes back up.\n",

      "Investments are very tricky and it’s hard to tell if you’re too late to invest into something, it’s just not possible to predict if it’s going to go up or down in the future (unless you’re like a future teller). Same thing goes for crypto, all of this is a huge gamble – it’s really just a huge gamble. You either win or lose, based on a pure luck.\n",
      "There have been a lot of analysis’ released as well as Bitcoin predictions, one of them is pointing at Bitcoin reaching $1M (though by 2020).\n",

      "And then all of this should mean that Bitcoin is going to become stronger as more and more companies and countries are adapting it. So I say hold on to them and don’t cash out all in the same time, it’s a lot of money. Look at the price analyses and see how the market is going for you. You can always use Bitcoin to pay for things without cashing out, but I’d probably think about it as an investment and you already did a good job with buying it at that early stage.\n",

      "What is Bitcoin mining?\n",
      "Mining cryptocurrency is like mining gold or silver at a mountain. When you start digging into a mountain it's relatively easy but over time you will need more advanced equipment as the process gets dangerous and difficult. Mining cryptocurrency is basically solving mathematical problems and these problems get difficult with time. As the difficulty increases the miner would need fast and reliable technology.\n",
      "How to start mining?\n",
      "To start mining you need hardware (ASIC for Bitcoin and GPU for other cryptocurrencies) and electricity. Setting up a mining rig is expensive and requires cheap electricity so instead people join mining clouds.\n",

      "You can do so by selling off your existing bitcoins. There are different ways to sell your bitcoins. The most popular way is, selling through the online exchanges. The online bitcoin exchanges act as an intermediary, holding funds of the exchanging parties. First of all, you need to go through an identity verification process but after that, it’s all very simple. And the best part is, you don’t have to do the rest of the work like organizing sales. After the identity verification, you have to place a ‘sell’ order specifying the amount of bitcoins you want to sell and also the price per unit as per your needs. As soon as someone places a ‘buy’ order that matches the amount of your ‘sell’ order, the exchange takes place and the amount is credited to your account in the desired currency.\n",
      "There are two other ways to do so. One is direct online trades. In direct online trading, you create a trade advertisement including the amount of bitcoins you’re willing to sell. And then you just need to post it on a trading website. There are hundreds of websites over the internet that let you create trade ads to help boost your sales. DigitalCoinsExchange is one of them.\n",
      "Last but not the least, you can also use bitcoin ATMs for the same purpose. However, one major limitation of using bitcoin ATMs is, ‘they’re not available everywhere.’ There are just 17 bitcoin ATMs in and around London. Also, you have to walk all the way to the bitcoin ATM to sell off your bitcoins. And there might not be a single bitcoin ATM in your vicinity.\n",

      "\n",
      "For starters, let’s consider what exactly it means to store bitcoin. Bitcoin is a virtual currency, so there aren’t physical bills or coins to store. Instead, storing bitcoin amounts to storing two things:\n",
      "An address/public key. If someone sends you bitcoin, what they are really doing is publicly announcing that they are sending bitcoin to your address. Storing the address/public key is relatively easy, because you don’t need to hide it from anyone*. In fact, here is one of my public keys: 13aPjxRFUeGMe59iG3W4soKYg5aqoJLSs5—feel free to send me bitcoin!\n",
      "A private key, which functions like a password. For the address I revealed above, I have a corresponding private key that is cryptographically bound in such a way that only I can prove ownership of the bitcoin residing at that address. Storing the private key is the hard part about storing bitcoin, because you want to be completely sure that it is safe and secure.\n",
      "Much as you probably divide your money between your purse/wallet and your bank account or safe, bitcoin storage can be conceptually divided into hot storage and cold storage. Hot storage is online and is readily available. Most users will either use a bitcoin “wallet” or an online exchange with storage capabilities (e.g. Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.) as their hot storage. Cold storage refers to offline storage—this can range from keeping a piece of paper with your keys to storing them on a USB drive and locking in a safe.\n",
      "As for me personally, I use a mix of hot storage and cold storage. My hot bitcoin are stored in an exchange, where I am ready to transact at will with two factor authentication (having my phone + knowing a password). My cold storage comprises paper wallet slips (each of which contain a public key and private key) locked in a safe in a bank account.\n",
      "For investors with very large amount of bitcoin, it is be worthwhile to use “t of n” threshold secret sharing instead of a single password. For example, in a 3 of 5 scheme, secret information is split amongst 5 stakeholders in such a way that the private key is revealed if and only if 3 or more of the stakeholders share their partial secret. This way, if one or two of the stakeholders are absent or malicious, the majority can still transact. Alternatively, Bitcoin has some native support for multi-sig transactions, which require multiple parties to participate in order for a transaction to be valid.\n",
      "* with the caveat that publicly announcing your address means that subsequent spends from that address can be easily traced to you since the blockchain is public.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to cryptocurrency wallets I use both an exchange and a hardware wallet. The coins I’m holding are on the hardware wallet and the ones I’m trading are on the exchange. This is my preferred method and it works very well for me.\n",
      "What is a cryptocurrency wallet?\n",
      "A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that you can use to store, send and receive various cryptocurrencies. The wallet doesn’t exactly “store” your money as a real-world wallet does. Instead, it saves your public and private keys which in turn helps you send and receive money.\n",
      "What are public and private keys?\n",
      "Let’s think of a real world situation before we understand what public and private keys are. Imagine a vending machine. Can anyone and put their money inside the machine right? But, they can’t take out the money because they don’t have the key, they can only put money in the machine. The only person who can take out the money is the owner of the machine who has the key.\n",
      "In this example, the vending machine is the public address which anyone uses to send money to you. You are the machine owner, and the key that he is carrying is your private key. Using this private key only you can access your money and do what you please with it.\n",
      "The public key is the address that anyone can use to send you the money, while the private key is what you will use to send money to anyone else. Remember, ONLY you should know what your private key is, otherwise anyone can use your wallet to send your money to any other addresses.\n",
      "Under no circumstances should you ever lose your private key. Let’s put this in super simple terms. If you lose your private key, then you are SCREWED (yes, uppercase has been used to emphasize the gravity of the situation). You should use at least two different techniques to save and store your private keys. We will discuss these various techniques a little later in the article.\n",

      "As of right now, let’s discuss the two methods of storage that you can use to store your cryptos, hot storage, and cold storage.\n",
      "Pros of hot storage\n",
      "Quick to access funds.\n",
      "A wide number of options, and support for different devices.\n",
      "User-friendly UIs make sending and receiving simple.\n",
      "Cons of hot storage\n",
      "Exposed to cybercrime. Sophisticated hackers, ransomware, and other malicious actors are a constant threat.\n",
      "Damaging the device could destroy the wallet. Without carefully backing up private keys, and seed words you could permanently lose your cryptocurrency investment.\n",
      "You could still lose/damage/have stolen the restoration details.\n",
      "Online Wallets aka Cloud Wallet\n",
      "These wallets are the easiest to use among all. The creation is super simple because it’s basically creating your own account on any of the exchange services. Furthermore, you can access this wallet from any server or any device in the world as long as it is connected to the net. Having said that, there is one big problem when it comes to online wallets. Your private key is going to be saved on another server. This is basically like serving up your key to hackers on a silver platter. Do NOT use online wallets to store huge amounts of your money. Store the bare minimum that you need for exchange purposes.\n",
      "Desktop/Mobile Wallets\n",
      "Desktop or mobile wallets are also popular choices for a hot wallet. These represent a much better option in terms of security. Desktop wallets are downloaded and installed on a single PC or laptop and they are only accessible from that one device where it was downloaded. While it is a safer alternative than an online wallet, it can still be very inconvenient because you will not get access to your money unless you are on the device from which you downloaded the wallet. MultiBit and Armory are great examples of desktop wallets.\n",
      "Mobile wallets are pretty convenient to use because all you need to do is to download an app into your phone. MyCelium is a really popular app(for both Android and iPhone) that people use for their mobile wallets, CoPay is a great option as well.\n",
      "The real problem with desktop/mobile wallets are the dangers associated with virus attacks. A hacker can easily put Trojans in your system to phish for your details. Apart from that, you can easily lose your cryptos if your desktop or mobile is damaged.\n",

      "Just like we need email providers to manage our emails, we need Bitcoin wallets to manage our Bitcoins. However, Bitcoin addresses look a bit more complex as they are made of a long string of letters and numbers (e.g. 16NsGhJdc7s8XJyRGsQV6msSJRpMZJCGFf).\n",
      "It is, basically, a combination of keys (Public Key and Private Key) that keeps our Bitcoin stored. The aforementioned bitcoin address – or Public Address (PA) – is the address you share with others when you want to receive Bitcoins (it is safe to share your Public Address just like sharing you email address). On the other hand, the Private Key (PK) is like the password to access your email account and it is used to unlock and move (or spend) the coins stored in the public address (you should never share your Private Keys). Each Bitcoin address results in a unique combination of a Public and Private Key.\n",
      "Instead of using the Private Key complex combination of letters and numbers, some wallets make use of mnemonic seeds (or phrases), which work in a very similar way. This technique removes the need of dealing directly with the Private Key, making it more user-friendly. The seed phrase is as unique as the Private Key it represents, thus also exclusive to each Public Address. Mnemonic seeds are basically Private Keys made better looking.\n",
      "There are many different types of Bitcoin wallets, such as: Web, Mobile, Desktop, Paper and Hardware Wallets. Each type of wallet has particular mechanisms and its own way of storing the Private Keys.\n",
      "Web Wallets\n",
      "A Web wallet is an online Bitcoin wallet that stores your Private Keys online and can only be accessed with a user-set password. The wallet provider generates a Public Key (Address) for you to deposit/send your bitcoins to. They will store your Bitcoins and hold the Private Keys for you. In this case, you do not have direct access to your Bitcoins anymore since you do not have the Private Keys (held by the service provider).\n",
      "Examples of Web wallets: Green Address; Blockchain.info.\n",
      "The Web wallets are also used by exchanges and all users need to deposit their coins into the Exchange wallet before using their services (e.g. Coinbase, Bittrex, Binance).\n",
      "Desktop Wallets\n",
      "A Desktop wallet is a software you download and install on your computer that may be used to access previously generated Bitcoin addresses or to generate new ones. When generating a new Bitcoin Address, users are able to set a password for their newly generated wallet and to keep control of their Private Keys (only you have access to your Bitcoins; no need to trust third-party services).\n",
      "Examples of Desktop wallets: Electrum, Exodus, Bitcoin Core\n",
      "Mobile Wallets\n",
      "The Mobile wallets are very similar to Desktop wallets but designed for smartphones. They may be very convenient for quick transfers, but since the Private Keys are stored on your mobile phone, these wallets offer low security and low privacy – given the potential association of your Bitcoin wallet with your phone number and location.\n",
      "Examples of Mobile wallets:\n",
      "GreenBits; Electrum; Mycelium.\n",
      "Paper Wallets\n",
      "The Paper wallets are considered one of the most secure wallets available. The process of generating new addresses and keys can be done online using BitAddress or any other Paper wallet provider. However, it is recommended that you download their webpage and generate the addresses offline. After generating the Public and Private Keys, the user may write down the keys on a piece of paper or simply print and store in a secure place. By keeping your keys on a piece of paper, only someone that has physical access to this piece of paper can possibly steal your Bitcoins. As paper wallets may be physically destroyed or lost, it is advised that you create multiple copies.\n",
      "Recommended Paper wallet generator: BitAddress.\n",
      "Hardware Wallets\n",
      "Hardware wallets are physical devices especially designed to safely store your Private Keys. They are considered the safest way of storing cryptocurrencies. Even if your device gets compromised by malware, your keys will remain safe, which makes it possible to be used in any computer (even infected ones). Most hardware wallet companies provide a seed backup in case your device is lost or stolen. The only downside to this kind of storage, is that you need to have your device with you in case you want to send your Bitcoins.\n",

      "Bitcoin, the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, was created as a peer to peer payment system that allows its users to transfer value with no central authority or third party involved. Since a network of distributed and mostly anonymous miners are all in charge of processing the transactions, we are ensured that problems like censorship, fraud, and others are not possible.\n",
      "The automated issuance mechanism of bitcoin through mining also seeks to remove the control of money printing from privately owned banks that lend said money to governments at an interest, creating the debt-based economy that led to the crash in 2008, which in turn led to the creation of Bitcoin. However, we have become somewhat detached from the primary goal of Bitcoin, to return the control of money to its owners, and we entrust our Bitcoin with third party services daily. The most popular of these services being exchanges.\n",
      "Centralized exchanges are easy to use, easy to access and they provide advanced trading functionalities like margin trading and others. However, they also represent a security risk for your funds. While some exchanges are better guarded than others, hacks are not an uncommon event in the cryptocurrency scene, and some like the recent Bitfinex hack have led thousands of users losing their savings. Some exchanges are simply incompetent or malicious, practicing fractional reserve systems that can either lead to a voluntary elimination of the excess instruments (Mt. Gox hack from June 2011), bankruptcy (the demise of mybitcoin) or a new investor bailout. The Mt. Gox case had such an impact on the Bitcoin community that it led to the term \"Getting Goxed\".\n",
      "Nevertheless, we need to exchange our currencies. There are certain items and services that we cannot buy with Bitcoin (yet) and in order to acquire Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, most people have to exchange it for a national currency. Furthermore, some cryptocurrencies like Ether or Bitshares have special features or tools that are not present in Bitcoin. So how can we exchange our coins without entrusting them to a third party service? The answer lies with decentralized exchanges.\n",
      "A decentralized exchange is an exchange market that does not rely on a third party service to hold the customer's funds. Instead, trades occur directly between users (peer to peer) through an automated process. This system can be achieved by creating proxy tokens (crypto assets that represent a certain fiat or crypto currency) or assets (that can represent shares in a company for example) or through a decentralized multi-signature escrow system, among other solutions that are currently being developed.\n",
      "This system contrasts with the current centralized model in which users deposit their funds and the exchange issues an IOU that can be freely traded on the platform. When a user asks to withdraw his funds, these are converted back into the cryptocurrency they represent and sent to their owner.\n",
      "The most obvious benefit to using a decentralized exchange over a centralized one is their \"trustless\" nature. You are not required to trust the security or honesty of the exchange since the funds are held by you in your personal wallet and not by a third party.\n",
      "Another advantage to the decentralized model is the privacy it provides. Users are not required to disclose their personal details to anyone, except if the exchange method involves bank transfers, in which case your identity is revealed only to the person that is selling or buying from you.\n",
      "Furthermore, the hosting of decentralized exchanges is distributed through nodes meaning that there is no risk of server downtime.\n",
      "Of course, there is always a downside and this case is no exception. Centralized exchanges are extremely popular for many reasons.\n",
      "Some decentralized exchanges like Bitsquare require users to be online in order for an order to be listed and for the trade to take place, requiring users to perform certain actions like signaling that a payment was received.\n",
      "Trading features like margin trading, lending and stop loss are currently not available in the decentralized model as they only allow the basic exchange of currency for a predetermined value.\n",

      "TL;DR: Supply and Demand\n",
      "\n",
      "Supply\n",
      "Mining: the monetary base is increased by the each mining reward until it reaches 21MM by the end of this century\n",
      "\n",
      "Money loss you have to factor in a continuos loss of bitcoins. The rate is hard to estimate, thought people are more attentive now. Missing: hard drive containing Bitcoins worth £4m in Newport landfill site\n",
      "Smaller Supply floats come from 'wales' suddenly inflating the market with cash\n",
      "\n",
      "Demand\n",
      "The Demand for bitcoin depends on (1) speculation, less on (2) use as a payment medium. Events like the recent Bitcoin XT fork have a major impact on the price\n",
      "What Is Bitcoin XT: A Primer For Everyone\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course supply and demand determines price - price being basically where the supply and demand curves intersect. What makes the price go up and down is that the slope of these curves (and hence the point where they intersect) changes depending on the market environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes the volatility in the price ie: the variance and the randomness in its movement, and what I guess the question is really after, is market liquidity. This is basically the ability to get a deal done. Or more accurately the difference in price expectations between buyers and sellers. The more buyers and sellers in a market at a point in time the more competition there will be to get a deal done and the closer price expectations will be. Fewer buyers and sellers in a market mean a small imbalance will quickly push the price up or down.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I really, really think the question is after is what affects liquidity at the moment. Would love to see some real-money data on this but I suspect the proportion of speculative btc buys and sells vs those facilitating actual exchange of products and services is currently just huge. That and the lack of a derivatives market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How does Bitcoin price fall and rise?\n",
      "Exactly the same as any commodity price in the world falls and rise. The law of supply and demand. It never goes out of fashion, does it?\n",
      "The price of a bitcoin is tied purely to the laws of supply and demand. In other words, the price is determined only by what the market contributors are willing to pay. If more people want to buy bitcoins, then the price will increase. If more people want to sell, the price will decrease. That’s how it works. Pretty much the same?\n",
      "But why does it fall and rise so often? or why is so much volatile?\n",
      "Boom - More and more people are finding out about it and they want’s their hands full.\n",
      "Relatively small market size - Bitcoin’s value can be volatile when compared to more established currencies and commodities. This can be attributed to its relatively small market size, and it means that a smaller amount of money can move the Bitcoin price more significantly. This discrepancy will decrease naturally over time as the currency matures and the market size increases.\n",
      "There are many other factors involved but I guess these are the important ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The value of bitcoins is related not only to its supply and demand but also to network effects. Network effects in the field of computing and economics states that the value of a network is directly related to the number of daily unique users on the network. A model for this value was presented on this blog: A Macro-Mathematical Model for the Observed Value of Digital BlockChain Networks. Metcalfe’s law that states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the nodes on it was shown to approximately apply. Another network model relating the value to the exponent of the square of the number of daily active users on the network was shown to model the price quite well.\n",
      "The theory of supply and demand in economics is a quasi-steady state one for a system in an equilibrium state. For new networks that is recently being introduced to users, the system is hardly yet in quasi-steady state and the simple theory of demand and supply alone no longer suffices. In such systems, network growth analysis may prove to better model the value of the system. More mathematical details are available in above link.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to a stock market.\n",
      "The number of Bitcoins is known at any given time, and increases by a determined rule. That’s more regulated than stocks of a company usually are, the number of which can in fact arbitrarily get increased. But still in principle, their number is fixed.\n",
      "So how do the price change?\n",
      "What is not fixed, is the market price of bitcoin. Nowadays it’s determined by buyers on sellers on big exchanges where you can trade Bitcoin versus US Dollar, Euro, or whatever else seems feasible. Again, this works *exactly* like a stock exchange. There’s an order book where buyers and sellers set up their trading goal, and buy and sell orders get matched.\n",
      "So it’s the perception of market participants which makes the price. That’s all there is. And the same is valid for those altcoins and platform tokens similar to Bitcoin.\n",
      "An important benchmark of bitcoin is called “market capitalization” which is simply the going price times the number of existing coins. E.g. if one bitcoin is traded for $2000, and there are 16 million, so the marketcap would be 16M * $2000 = 32 000 M $\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The price of everything fluctuates—US Dollar, price of gold, stocks, bonds on an on. The question is why does Bitcoin price fluctuate so much? The answer is—the price of bitcoin has no underlying basis. The price of stocks can be related to the underlying value of the firm they represent. In the case of bitcoin, the value is entirely crowd sourced. There are no models of value that represents a nominal price. NO WAIT, there are too many models! There is AFIK no accepted pricing model which relates the price to available system statistics.\n",
      "That said, the price is a matter of opinion as it affects buyers and sellers. Big hacking adventure announcements lead buyers to stay away and sellers to try to dump their holdings. Promising adoption of bitcoin by big players causes the reverse. Lack of a fundamental basis leaves the field to Technical Analysts who attempt to anticipate price movements. IMHO as a controls engineer, that prediction methods adds to the instability of any prediction system.\n",
      "Other answers to this question inventory the perturbations which drive the price. The underlying pricing mechanisms, being virtually non-existent, leads to a result which can only be predicted by guessing the psychology of would be buyers and sellers.\n",

      "SPOILER ALERT\n",
      "In the picture — and the movie — those two people are the same person. That is the big plot twist at the end. One of them is the original mild mannered protagonist (played by Edward Norton) — the other is his alter ego … a badass, outspoken, trouble making man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).\n",
      "At the start of the movie we learn about our mild tempered hero. We sympathize with him, feel for him, identify with him. Then we meet Tyler Durden — and the whole story takes a wild turn.\n",
      "Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash seems to be a similar story.\n",
      "In my own book — Bitcoin Vs. The 2018 Recession — I partially address this debate. I’ll address it here too.\n",
      "Bitcoin is the original, the mild-mannered protagonist of a 9 year story. It’s been used and developed, bugs fixed and hacks dealt with, over the course of nearly a decade. It’s built itself a reputation among the minds of millions around the world. It’s reputation has increased to such an extent that large companies are buying in (ETF’s, etc).\n",
      "Bitcoin has mindshare, brand recognition, a global community, and myriad wondrous cryptocurrency elements.\n",
      "Bitcoin also has a slow network and large transfer fee’s.\n",
      "Bitcoin Cash is the new man — the new split personality. It split off the main personality 6 months ago. It’s brash, antagonistic, and fighting for its place in the crypto world. In an ironic sense BCC is like Tyler Durden — the almost exact opposite of its original (Bitcoin) in personality.\n",
      "Bitcoin Cash has a faster network, smaller fee’s, and adjusts its algorithm quicker than BTC.\n",
      "Yet for all this it has much less mindshare, less brand recognition, and a global community that is very much divided about it.\n",
      "The fight is strong. Bitcoin Cash people believe BCC is the real Bitcoin — almost as if the split personality were fighting for dominance over the original. Bitcoin people believe BCC is a money grab, centralized, and many other rejecting thoughts. Who will win?\n",
      "We’re in a fascinating time in history here. There are several scenarios to consider:\n",
      "Bitcoin could adopt the Lightning network, Atomic Swaps, and other improvements to speed up its network, reduce fees, and dominate the crypto world once again. This would reduce BCC to an alt coin, a hedge, with a small but zealous community. The drama would subside and BTC would rise again.\n",
      "Bitcoin Cash could convince enough people worldwide of its dominance, thus gaining mindshare, brand recognition, and the legitimacy it needs to really fight for the Bitcoin name. This would result in a ‘flippening’ — which short term would throw all the new people into a state of utter confusion and lead to possible massive losses in value as new people flee or are otherwise discouraged from buying. Long term though — BCC will have won.\n",
      "These are the two major scenarios. There are many other offshoots and branches, but those are best saved for lengthy discussions over bottles of scotch.\n",
      "What it all honestly comes down to is — timing.\n",
      "Can Bitcoin maintain its strong position long enough for its developers to implement the lightning network and thus reduce fees while speeding up transactions? If so then BTC will fight through the drama and remain victorious.\n",
      "On the other hand….\n",
      "Can Bitcoin Cash keep up its attack while maintaining low fees and fast transactions — long enough that it converts a large enough populous to back them? If so then BCC may come out the winner.\n",
      "These are incredibly difficult questions. Simply because we are (in late December 2017) on the verge of truly massive adoption. The masses are circling the bandwagons. Which one will they jump on?\n",

      "Now as the popularity of the show will keep on increasing, the demand for the action figure will also keep on increasing. As long as the supply of this item meets the demand, the price of the item will remain $50. If the supply increases, the price may drop. Now in case the supply decreases, but the demand keeps on increasing, the price of the commodity will keep on increasing as long as their is no alternative available in the market.This is because for every person out there who is willing to pay $50 for this item, there will be 2–3 more people who will be willing to pay much more than $50 dollars, because they might feel that the value of the commodity is way more than $50.\n",

Initially people started investing in it because they were able to transact amongst themselves without the need of a bank at very low transaction fees. This resulted in more and more people to use this currency. But since Bitcoin has a limited quantity, the price started rising when more and more people started using it, till it reached 1000$ when people started thinking of it as a good investing opportunity and this year on November it reached $7500!!\n",

      "POP.\n",
      "Look at this bubble popping.\n",
      "the lightest touch of an outside force and this once glorious little vision of rainbow water and soap — ceases to exist.\n",
      "Where did the bubble go? It popped and now it’s gone. No trace remains. It’s vanished. Can’t find it, can’t bring it back, certainly can’t re-inflate it.\n",
      "Is this about to happen to Bitcoin?\n",
      "Will the Bitcoin bubble pop and Bitcoin will cease to exist? Will it be no more?\n",
      "I discuss this deeply in my book: Bitcoin vs the 2018 Recession. But for now let’s take a quick look at the answer:\n",
      "If bubbles pop and cease to exist — why did we call the Dot-com era a ‘bubble’? When it popped did we stop using the internet? Was the internet gone forever? Or the 2008 mortgage crisis -- why did we call it the ‘housing bubble’? When it popped did we stop living in houses? Forever?\n",
      "I take issue with the term ‘Bitcoin bubble.’ It causes panic. It implies Bitcoin may ‘pop’ and cease to exist -- forever. This fear paralyzes the mind. You see your hard earned money popping -- vanishing in an instant -- and all further thinking instantly stops. The visual is so simple, so powerful, we accept it as true. But what if it’s false? What if Bitcoin isn’t a bubble? What if Bitcoin is something else -- and our minds are too paralyzed to see it?\n",
      "To illustrate imagine yourself as a hard working farmer in some dusty little village sleeping on the far flung outskirts of civilization. Each month you go to your village’s market. You trade bushels of wheat for shoes, for nails, for little sweets for your kids. Each trade is unique and the value of your wheat for your neighbors cows is always fluctuating based on crops, seasons and needs. That’s how you’ve always done it. That’s how your grandfather’s grandfather did it -- and as far as you’re concerned that’s how your grandchildren’s grandchildren will do it. Then one day a merchant arrives.\n",
      "This merchant hails from a “city” -- a place you’ve never been to but know from tall tales and strange stories. The stories paint a picture of squalor, rampant violence, brothels, and drugs. Naturally you eye this merchant with a healthy dose of suspicion. Your suspicion doubles as he approaches you.\n",
      "“I’d like to buy your entire harvest of wheat,” he says, a foreign twang to his tongue.\n",
      "“I see,” you say, eyeing the merchant and his completely empty wagon. “And what do you offer in trade?”\n",
      "“Trade?” he repeats apologetically. “No no, my good man. I will buy it from you -- with these.” At that he pulls a leather sack from his satchel. Onto his palm he pours shiny round bits of metal. Each bit is stamped with the profile of the monarch or king or whoever it is that claims to rule your lands -- though you’ve never seen this king in person, just the wars he’s caused.\n",
      "“Excuse me?” you say, blinking in disbelief. “I’ve worked quite hard for this harvest, thank you very much. I won’t be trading my year’s work for shiny bits and baubles.”\n",
      "“They’re called ‘coins’,” he replies patiently. “When you go to the city you trade them for food, drink, pleasurable company, anything your heart desires. Soon enough you and your neighbors will be using them to trade between yourselves!”\n",
      "The words ‘soon enough’ sound like a threat to you, your neighbors, and the way you’ve all been conducting business for centuries. A stout group of yeomen promptly run the merchant out of town -- with a proper coating of tar and feathers for good measure.\n",
      "And that’s how money started -- more or less. It had a rocky road. People feared money. They feared putting trust in it. What if they slaved all year long raising their cattle and chucking their wheat -- then traded it for round metal disks -- only to go to a city and find the metal wasn’t accepted for anything.\n",
      "Bitcoin sits in a similar predicament. It comes from the internet, a place of both tremendous civilization and harmful vice. It’s associated with tall tales of drug lords and strange stories of hitmen-for-hire. The merchants peddling it are often ‘foreigners’ -- geeks and nerds who speak with strange words like ‘decentralization, hashpower, nodes, DDoS, and HODL.’ And then they try to convince you to accept this ‘magic internet money’ created by a king -- Satoshi Nakamoto -- who you’ve never seen. No wonder you’re skeptical.\n",
      "Bitcoin hasn’t gained trust yet. It’s still exotic, strange, and fairly difficult to wrap your head around. But dispelling these misconceptions is only a matter of time.\n",
      "Bitcoin will gain trust.\n",
      "Perhaps when we start thinking we’ll push past the paralysis of thinking Bitcoin is a bubble. Perhaps then we will see Bitcoin for what it truly is: not a bubble -- but a new Boom. Like the industrial boom. Like the tech boom. Bitcoin is the beginning of the financial boom.\n",
      "That is not to say we have rosy cheeks and sunny skies ahead. Each revolution has its sensational successes with equally miserable depressions. The industrial revolution contributed to wars just as much as it contributed to global progress. The tech revolution caused trillions of dollars of economic loss just as much as it ushered in a fantastic digital world. Bitcoin likewise has many more hurdles to jump. Prices will skyrocket and sink and climb and fall. New financial innovations will allow anyone with a smartphone to be their own bank, lender, creditor -- while traditional banks may collapse. Trust will fluctuate with alarming volatility.\n",
      "But make no mistake. Bitcoin is not a bubble. It will not pop and cease to exist. Instead it will be a new boom. A financial revolution.\n",

      "I suggest that you rather invest in shares\n",
      "Now you may ask, why should I buy shares?\n",
      "Answer - Shares are designed to provide investors with two types of return( imagine them as 2 ways to increase your Net worth), annual income and long-term capital growth.\n",
      "Most shares offer income in the form of dividends, which are typically paid twice a year. Dividends can be seen as a reward for shareholders. They are paid when a company is profitable and has cash in the bank after it has satisfied all its obligations.\n",
      "Long-term (Going Long) capital growth comes about when a share price increases over a period of time. This is why most investors like Warren Buffet practice “Buy and Hold” investing, he buys and never sells. Once you buy a share you keep it with you for 20–60 years and you reap the rewards along the way.\n",
      "This is just one way you can grow your money. Since you get a yearly income from Shares and if you so choose sell your shares when they reach a higher price.\n",

      "Momentum.\n",
      "Remember learning about momentum back in school? The equation was simple enough. Momentum = mass X velocity.\n",
      "In school we learned all about momentum affecting physical objects. A bowling ball has momentum as it rolls down the lane. The bowling ball hits a bunch of wobbly pins and they go FLYING in all directions — because momentum was transferred to them.\n",
      "In a similar metaphorical sense — Bitcoin has momentum.\n",
      "Bitcoin has: brand name recognition, the largest marketcap, and a global network of miners. All these contribute to BTC’s momentum.\n",
      "Alt coins also have momentum. But compared to BTC — they are mere pins down a bowling alley lane. If an alt coin goes up — or down — BTC doesn’t budge. However when Bitcoin begins to roll — others roll with it.\n",
      "This is partly because Bitcoin’s momentum also seems to be a way for people to gauge ‘market sentiment.’\n",
      "If BTC is up — that means the market must be up. If BTC is down — market must be down.\n",
      "One day this will change. Though Bitcoin’s momentum will continue to increase (in my opinion), other cryptocurrencies will gain similar momentum. Ethereum for example is well on its way to doing so.\n",
      "For now, however, BTC’s momentum is the solar star which other alt coin planets revolve around. And if BTC sinks, they will sink too — which is unfortunate as some alt coins have some great tech.\n",
      "As far as the ‘bubble bursting’ — that is a term I take issue with. The term bubble conjures up some frightful images. A popping bubble means everything is gone — forever!\n",
      "But Bitcoin is not a bubble — at least not in the sense that it will burst and everything will be gone. Just like when the ‘dot com bubble’ burst we didn’t stop using the internet. Just like when the ‘housing bubble’ burst we didn’t stop living in houses. When the bitcoin ‘bubble’ bursts we won’t stop using BTC or blockchain. Bitcoin’s momentum may drag all the altcoins down — but they won’t cease to exist.\n",
      "I’ve been traveling for 3 months now (November to January). Around the world on 1 Bitcoin. I’ve been meeting and interviewing blockchain developers in China, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Myanmar, and now in Thailand.\n",
      "The momentum in the blockchain space is tremendous. The people I’ve met — sharp, driven, A-type people — are developing their projects to change the world. Many may not succeed. But it won’t be for a lack of trying. Or for a ‘bitcoin bubble burst’. If the bubble burst on them today — they would still be in the office working to change the world.\n",
      "That is momentum I can get behind.\n",

      "Cryptocurrency is called digital money or money of internet . Crypto word is mainly used because it is based on cryptography and currency means money. You can go to Wikipedia to search for it for better understanding. But I will answer better in point of investment - Yes , Investment in crypto is better than current securities - like stocks ,bonds ,mutual funds etc. But to what amount? CRYPTO market is just 8 years old and only market cap of around 160billion dollars .which accounts for less than 1% of total world GDP. It is stated that by global forum by 2025 , 10% of the GDP will be in crypto .But the question is why it is increasing in that pace ? The answer is because of it's demand ,it's useability , security , decentralisation ,limited supply and as a source of value in economic breakdown.We are in golden age of crypto where many people does even heard about Bitcoin or other crypto.And the point is even they have heard how many of them invest. How a currency like Bitcoin which has a value of cent in 2010 has grown to massive 4000$? Many of the countries have also adopted Bitcoin as a legal currency like -Japan , Australia and many more to say. Go to CoinDesk - Leader in blockchain news. and check the list There are about more than 95% doesn't treat them illegal and many of them legalised.Bitcoin is acting like a currencies but they are many other Crypto which are solving many major problem and they are initial phase of development and they price to going to moon but still undervalued. Invest in that project, investing in crypto means you are actually supporting the project and upcoming it and increasing the probability of their success.You can check the list of coins in CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations .Have a visit to the website look throw the website of each current understand their solve and analyse how much probability of them to success. And my final advice don't just put all your money in just one crypto spread them out. Investment the money that you can forgot and don't effecting your bread and lifestyle.If you are not mature enough don't trade just invest otherwise you will loose.Definitely 90% of the people loose money.If you very interested in trading go and learn first and trade on virtual money unless you are comfortable.\n",

      "I'll try to answer your questions as briefly as possible.\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies are a new and unregulated asset class. Most coins are backed by literally nothing - no good developers, no proper roadmap or funding, nothing. Your hard earned money gets you \"tokens\" which have no inherent value except a number on a screen. If you're investing in something other than the top 20 cryptocurrencies (ie. Bitcoin or Ethereum), it's akin to gambling. You'll probably lose everything overnight.\n",
      "That being said, I'll explain Bitcoin and its value for you. Bitcoin is a virtual, decentralised currency. But what is it? It's just a few lines of code. Every coin is just a few 1s and 0s. What gives it value? The fact that other people think it's worth something. There are hundreds if not thousands of exchanges, businesses, miners and users who have invested time and money into this system. People believe in Bitcoin and its value, and thus, it has value.\n",
      "What does Bitcoin do? Well, your money is free from the control of governments. You can send millions of dollars across borders with a $1 fee in two minutes. It's pretty revolutionary. However, if you buy Bitcoin, think of it as buying a piece of the network, and NOT as an investment. There is a very solid chance that you will lose every dime. However, since it is a new and growing space, the upside is unimaginable.\n",
      "TL;DR: Bitcoin is awesome. You may lose all your money. Invest a bit and be safe!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not very.\n",
      "Crypto-tokens are still a young, innovative, and exciting market. That’s pretty much the opposite of old, well-established, and safe when it comes to investing.\n",
      "Cryptos are for the most part early-stage startup enterprises, and as any small businessman or venture capitalist will tell you, the large majority of startups fail. If you’re buying into a promising new ICO, there’s probably a 90% chance of it failing/falling to zero within 5 years.\n",
      "Cryptos are unregulated and international. That means a group of kids in a basement in Estonia can put up a reasonable looking but fraudulent cryptocoin or service to scam the unwary and the greedy. (nothing against the Estonians, by the way, they also have some great crypto projects going).\n",
      "Cryptos are like cash. If you screw up they can be lost or stolen and there’s nothing anybody can do about it after the fact. If you leave a pile of $1000 on your phone without backup and lose your phone, that $1000 is gone, just the same as if you dropped a wallet full of cash into the ocean. If you leave $5000 on your computer and get hacked, that $5000 is gone, the same as if you left a pile of cash on your dining room table and a neighbor broke in. If you leave $10,000 on an exchange (like a brokerage account), it’s not insured. It’s like an old-style bank with a vault. If the vault is robbed/hacked, your $10,000 is gone.\n",
      "As a new technology with an aim to disrupt the bloated traditional finance industry, cryptos are David vs. Goliath. Goliath has a lot of money to buy politicians and enact regulation that can hamper or cripple crypto adoption. There is serious regulatory risk for all crypto investments, and even in the U.S. we’re seeing disturbingly authoritarian posturing against crypto innovations and users.\n",
      "In terms of investing even the most well-established coins like bitcoin and ethereum are extremely volatile. In the last year, bitcoin alone experienced five major “crashes” that would have been considered catastrophic on the stock market, and one megacrash that would have been world-ending on the stock market. Most people don’t have the personality or stomach for that type of volatility (unless they have experience in derivatives or leveraged futures markets) and they trade stupidly. Cryptos are very “not safe” for undisciplined, emotional investors. As a small part of an investment portfolio with frequent rebalancing that volatility can be a good thing, though - it can increase your returns while even reducing your overall risk, but only if you are a disciplined investor.\n",
      "Anyone should treat investing in crypto as a highly speculative thing that you do with a small part of your portfolio - money that you can afford to lose and that you expect to lose, but that you hope to triple. Do your homework thoroughly, watch out for scams, be safe, maintain a sense of humor and detachment, and enjoy the ride.\n",

Price can be reaching Sky or it will fall down to ground in a couple of seconds without supporting logical reasons. Rather there is a debate whether Crypto-currencies are commodities or currencies.\n",
      "Security is a major issue - Hackers are always behind you. Such transactions are not secure. Your bitcoin can be easily stolen. In August-2016, bitcoin worth $78 mln were stolen from Bitfinex exchange in Hong Kong. (Source: Bitcoin worth $78m stolen from Bitfinex exchange in Hong Kong)\n",
      "Anonymity - Worst enemy of its own - Since bitcoin is based on block chain technology, identity of receiver and sender remains anonymous. Due to this anonymity, there is increase in fraud and crime. Rather bitcoin is mainly used in various illegal activities. Recent example is WannaCry attack.\n",
      "Not Legalized but not illegal as well - Most of countries have not legalized digital currency but it is not illegal as per their respective laws. So it is not backed by government, in case of fraud you will loose all your money and you can not do anything. Countries are still facing problem in how to legalize Crypto-currency.\n",
      "No authorized exchange or broker - There are no reasonable ways available to invest in bitcoin. You are more prone to risk of theft and fraud. “Back in 2014, Mt. Gox, a Japan-based exchange that was handling about 70% of all bitcoin transactions at the time, filed for bankruptcy. In its February 2014 bankruptcy filing, Mt. Gox listed 850,000 bitcoins that had been hacked, worth about $450 million at the time, and said it had also lost the $27 million in cash it purportedly had in its coffers.”\n",

Today, there are more than 500 different cryptocurrencies to choose from, but Bitcoin still enjoys the first mover advantage. While tax authorities, enforcement agencies, and regulators are still exploring the phenomenon, one pertinent question is—is bitcoin legal or illegal? The answer is, it depends on the location and activity of the user.\n",
      "Bitcoins are not issued, endorsed, or regulated by any central bank. Instead, they are created through a computer-generated process known as mining. In addition to being a cryptocurrency unrelated to any government, Bitcoin is also necessarily a peer-to-peer payment system since it does not exist in any physical form and must be exchanged online. As such, it offers a convenient way to conduct cross-border transactions with no exchange rate fees. It also allows users to remain anonymous. (Related reading The Risks Of Buying Bitcoin)\n",

The currency is being traded on exchanges, and companies have even made investments in virtual currency-related ventures.

      "Bitcoin is legal in Canada\n",
      "Canada’s relationship with Bitcoin is similar to that of the US. The country’s Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has classified this digital currency as a commodity. This implies that transactions in Bitcoin are perceived as barter transactions. The income generates by these transactions is considered to be the business income. The taxation of Bitcoin is depending on its nature.\n",
      "Bitcoin exchanges in Canada are also subject to the anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Moreover, the exchanges are obliged to register with Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC).\n",

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is classifying Bitcoin transactions as a barter ones. Therefore, they are subject to related taxation law.\n",
      "Bitcoin in Europe\n",
      "Europe and the EU have been following the developments in the Bitcoin market for a long time.

      "Bitcoin in the Netherlands: The Dutch have granted Bitcoin transaction a status of barter transactions. This implies that it does not need to follow specific licensing or compliance rules. The Dutch Finance Minister has stated: “Bitcoin is not a financial product as defined by law, purchase or sale of bitcoins is not a financial service either, so the financial services act does not apply”.\n",
      "Bitcoin in France: The French have set onerous regulation and a form of Green listing on the Bitcoin sector. This implies that the French government is claiming that it is necessary that any exchange or wallet must hold data about the user, which is not a feature of Bitcoin.\n",
      "Bitcoin in Singapore\n",
      "The government of Singapore has declared Bitcoin as a good to buy another, thus determining the taxation need. The Monetary Authority of Singapore also obliged exchanges and ATM provides to Green list, similar to the French Bitcoin law.\n",

      "The best part of their investment program is that you get your investment plus the return, they don't keep your initial invesment.\n",
      "2. Through their referral program. Startup: 0$\n",
      "This is great if you don't have any money to invest. You get 50% of each deposit that is made under your referral link.\n",
      "It's easy very easy to do it, I'm doing it myself with great success. You go to their referral section, enter the Bitcoin address where you want to get paid and they will generate a unique URL for you. Each time a deposit is made under your referral link you get paid straight to your Bitcoin address 50% of the initial investment, with no delays.\n",
      "The minimum anyone can deposit is 0.02 BTC, that means that the minimum commission you could get is 0.01 which is pretty awesome.\n",
      "You can share the link on forums, social media etc. Easy to do. This works. Today I got a 0.3 referral.\n",

      "1. Answer surveys to earn free Bitcoin\n",
      "You’ve probably answered a survey or two in your lifetime, but did you know you could be getting paid for it?\n",
      "Online surveys have been around for ages. For those who don’t know, these are questionnaires-of-sorts that can be completed over the internet.\n",
      "Most of today’s online surveys are created as simple web forms, linked to a database that stores every answer. The answers are used to create infographics, provide analytics, or to identify market sentiment, brand awareness or conduct broad market research.\n",
      "As an example, a business owner might conduct an online survey to determine whether a demographic of people would be interested in purchasing a new product or service, or to learn the market’s opinion about a certain subject.\n",
      "Paid online surveys often work by rewarding people with vouchers, rebates or money when they answer a series of questions.\n",
      "Bitcoin surveys on the other hand are still fairly new to the market, yet they’re mostly similar to the traditional ones — the only difference being that free Bitcoin is given out as an incentive instead of coupons.\n",
      "By repetitively answering Bitcoin-based online surveys, you can earn small amounts of the digital currency.\n",
      "2. Try out apps, view websites and click ads for Bitcoin\n",
      "Another method of earning free Bitcoin is to access websites offering “bonus programs”.\n",
      "The way this works is that website owners and people pay you to do a task (like viewing an ad, downloading an app or trying out a new game). In return for time spent to do these things, the people posting these offers give out Bitcoin, coupons or cash as incentives.\n",
      "Currently, there are numerous websites offering huge Bitcoin bonus programs. One example would be “Free Digital Money”, which is known for giving visitors access to over one thousand offers. Another popular site is BTCClicks.\n",
      "Some of the strange offers available on the internet include signing up to various websites and checking search engine results for certain specific searches. Lots of weird shit like that.\n",
      "Most bonus programs do not require users to register an account, yet sharing your Bitcoin address is required.\n",
      "3. Complete online jobs for Bitcoin (i.e. freelance)\n",
      "Find out something you are good at and enjoy, and offer your services online.\n",
      "This way, you’ll be getting paid in Bitcoin for the work that you do, which is virtually limitless. You can write, code, edit, proofread, design, enter data, conduct surveys, carry out research etc — and be paid in Bitcoin in return. In the long run, after working online for a while, and considering the possible value fluctuations of cryptocurrencies, you could end up making a small fortune without needing to invest anything else apart from time.\n",
      "As an example, I’m usually on the other end of this market. I found somebody to translate this website into the Russian language on Bitcointalk, and I paid another guy from the same place to write most of this page. In total, I’ve spent several thousand dollars hiring freelancers from Bitcointalk—and I’m not alone.\n",
      "4. Join a Bitcoin affiliate program (BitcoInvest.cc is the best in 2018, pays 20 times more than any other platform )\n",
      "People have been earning money online through affiliate marketing for years, and with the Bitcoin-revolution currently taking place, it’s no surprise that Bitcoin-based affiliate campaigns have appeared as well.\n",
      "Bitcoin affiliate programs are programs that incentivize promoting a good or service in exchange for revenue share in Bitcoin. Some companies pay up to 50% of revenue from customers you refer. If you’ve got a website or blog, or if you have rich friends, this is the best option for you.\n",
      "Most Bitcoin affiliate programs work by generating you a unique URL to share, which is tied to your account. Once you get a link, you can go ahead and promote it anywhere you’d like (within reason), and purchases made by people who click it will earn you a tasty commission.\n",
      "Sometimes, revenue is paid through a CPA (cost-per-action) model, but I prefer the revenue share models as it feels more transparent. Currently, most of the Bitcoin affiliate programs pay their affiliates in BTC, yet there are also a few which pay out fiat — choosing the right site depends on your financial preferences (I strongly recommend choosing a program which pays out in BTC).\n",
      "Driving traffic through affiliate programs is really simple. For example, if you have a blog and have shared your affiliate link, you’ll either get a percentage of all sales made by the people you have referred, or a fixed payment, depending on the programs that you are collaborating with.\n",
      "Perhaps the greatest thing about affiliate programs is that once you refer somebody, you get a lifetime commission from every single purchase they make. Somebody could follow you link, make an account but never purchase anything — years later, they’ll return and you’ll still get a cut. This means that your affiliate revenue should keep increasing as you build up more customers, and it will create a permanent stream of passive income so long as the business doesn’t shut down.\n",
      "5. Forum-based signature campaigns for Bitcoin\n",
      "If you enjoy spending your time on Bitcoin forums such as BitcoinTalk, why not join a signature campaign? They’re an added bonus to all of the threads you start, and replies that you make — no matter how shitty.\n",
      "Signature campaigns are often organized by an individual, company or group of people who would like to promote their services or products across the entire forum, and most signature campaigns tend to pay fairly well.\n",
      "To make life easier, some nice staffer by the name of “Mitchell” over at Bitcointalk has made a comprehensive list of all active signature campaigns that you can join. I recommend you check that out.\n",
      "Some signature campaigns require that you have a particular account level or that you post several times per day, however most campaigns are open to all users who submit on-topic posts. If you’re not a spammer or Nazi sympathiser, then there is a signature campaign for you somewhere.\n",
      "Depending on your current user rank on the forum (junior, member, senior member, hero member, legendary member or VIP), you will be entitled to a different payment, based on the structure being employed. Increasing your rank to earn more is fairly easy, as you’ll simply need to post often with on-topic comments. It’s not rocket science.\n",
      "Some signature campaigns pay per post you make, while others pay a fixed monthly or weekly price. It’s up to you to decide which payment model you prefer — I like the fixed ones since then I know exactly what to expect each month.\n",
      "On top of the free monthly Bitcoin, by joining a Bitcoin signature campaign, you’re going to learn more about the cryptocurrency, make new friends, and also become a more-respected member of the community.\n",

      "A Bitcoin faucet is a type of “reward system” that dispenses free Bitcoins, usually in exchange for completing a captcha or task. Think of it as a modern way to bribe the Internet for more web traffic.\n",
      "Surprisingly, the first Bitcoin faucet was invented by Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen in 2010.\n",
      "The amount of money you can make from a Bitcoin faucet varies: most only give away a few satoshis at a time, but with the right site and dedication you could easily make a few hundred dollars reasonably quickly. (By the way, one satishi is another name for a hundredth of a millionth BTC.)\n",
      "People create free Bitcoin faucets for a number of reasons, yet the most common driving forces are:\n",
      "To make a website appear more active (i.e. more active users)\n",
      "To invite new users in the hopes they’ll end up spending more than they take\n",
      "To introduce more people to Bitcoin\n",
      "To earn revenue from ads\n",
      "As an example, there are a ton of Bitcoin casinos which double-up as free Bitcoin faucets. This is because marketing can be difficult in the online gambling world — it’s a grey area, and casinos are often restricted from traditional advertising such as Google AdWords, YouTube ads, billboards and radio.\n",
      "One strategy that Bitcoin casinos have been using lately is to plainly give away free money through a Bitocin faucet. The goal here is to attract as many new players as possible. This might sound like a stupid idea for a casino operator to do, but it’s actually profitable.\n",
      "If it costs the casino $9,000 in giveaways in order to eventually find someone who blows $10,000, it’s still a return on investment. Casinos have worked out that giving money away is actually a good way to make money. Besides, most people who claim free Bitcoins from these faucets never withdraw it—they just give it back. Don’t make that mistake!\n",
      "I never recommend gambling away faucet money, because it usually never tends to work out. Instead, collect, collect, collect and collect, and then withdraw.\n",
      "Some sites allow you to withdraw instantly after a faucet collection, while others don’t. The usual trick to encourage you to gamble or abandon your free Bitcoins is to have a minimum withdrawal amount higher than what you can claim. No worries — just keep collecting, and you’ll be able to withdraw in no time.\n",
      "Usually Bitcoin faucets allow you to claim free money every few minutes, so if you collect 2 mBit every three minutes over four hours, you will have accumulated 160 mBit ($250). That’s not bad for a few hours of clicking!\n",
      "The sites that do allow you to withdraw instantly usually pay less than those who don’t, but if you accumulate enough, you can withdraw a pretty substantial sum of Bitcoin in no time. If you regularly use normal faucets to earn free Bitcoins, this may be a faster and more lucrative option than hopping many sites at once.\n",
      "Some Bitcoin casinos offer showers of Bitcoin, which usually pay the same amount as a faucet. The difference between a Bitcoin faucet and Bitcoin rain is that rain money gets distributed to everybody at once. Other than that, it’s essentially the same thing.\n",
      "7. Earning Bitcoin via tips\n",
      "In today’s world, tipping has become commonplace.\n",
      "When people appreciate something they read, or a service they have been given, they’ll sometimes pay to show their appreciation. With this in mind, earning Bitcoin by being tipped is not difficult at all.\n",
      "For example, if you have created a quirky reddit bot, or coded an application that you don’t want to sell, you can introduce your Bitcoin address near the download button. Those who are kind enough might donate/tip money to you if they like what you’ve created. The same principle applies if you own a blog and you write smart articles — copy and paste your Bitcoin address in the footer.\n",
      "Just try it: add a Bitcoin address to some content that others might like. Even if you think nobody will care enough to donate, there’s no harm in trying — you never know.\n",
      "8. Playing Free Bitcoin Games\n",
      "Bitcoin games are sometimes referred to as “fun faucets”.\n",
      "To put things better into perspective, they require zero investment and offer you small fractions of Bitcoin every time you win, manage to beat a level, or reach a higher score.\n",
      "These Bitcoin games normally make their money from smart ad campaigns, and can afford to give out small amounts of the cryptocurrency (in exchange for the massive influx of traffic).\n",
      "Therefore, if you’d rather play an actual game, then spend all day entering captchas on traditional faucet websites, then perhaps Bitcoin games are a better solution for you.\n",
      "9. Earn Bitcoin by mining\n",
      "Before anything else, it is important to be aware that mining Bitcoin won’t be easy, and it’ll likely require investing both time and money, bit I’ve included it anyway.\n",
      "Bitcoin mining nowadays requires purchasing, and keeping an eye on the mining equipment that will be doing all of the heavy lifting.\n",
      "During the last couple of years, mining Bitcoin has become considerably more difficult, while the rewards for each block mined have also gotten much lower. Currently, 12.5 BTC is given for each block mined, whereas last year, the reward was of 25 BTC.\n",
      "While you can theoretically mine the digital currency without a huge investment, the money you’ll make won’t really classify as a profit. In fact, you’ll probably be spending much more on electricity per month than you will earn through mining Bitcoin. If the value does end up increasing more, only then will the funds that you get classify as profit.\n",
      "10. Earn Bitcoin through trading\n",
      "Today, there are numerous methods of trading Bitcoin that you can try out. Generally, trading Bitcoin consists of buying low and selling high, while foreseeing the possible value fluctuations in the digital currency. However, becoming a trader can be quite difficult, considering the fact that you’ll have to know just about everything there is to know about the digital currency, and how it behaves on the market.\n",
      "Foreseeing market events, and predicting how the value will change is the key to making a profit while trading Bitcoin. While luck is also important to a certain extent, education, smart fund management, an understanding of the underlying market principles, and a love for FOREX are all required to make Bitcoin trading profitable.\n",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, you might also want to consider Bitcoin investment websites, Bitcoin CFDs and Bitcoin binary options, yet an initial investment will be needed, therefore, you won’t be technically earning Bitcoin for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Short term bitcoin is serging because of news and hype in media that it will fall.\n",
      "Long term if you think that this will become the currency of world that is wrong. Having said that the world currency is right now trading in bitcoin and it has become powerful as compared to big companies and investors who people have thought cannot be compared.\n",
      "When this news will suddenly will reduce as people will have the tendency to consume and get bored with the news easily they will look for next big news that will divert there investment. Might be possible gold can also be traded through block chain or bitcoin can now be made available to in abundance. You don’t think that can happen but if hackers can steel bitcoin then they can also change the coding of bitcoin as this is mere a software.\n",

Invest in tokens with a low market cap as they have the most potential for growth. My 2018 top picks for low market cap coins are Crypto Carbon (CCRB) and Aquarius Coin (ARCO). These coins and their innovative technologies will soar in 2018. Buy Aquarius coin at Cryptopia, a trustable exchange currently accepting registrations. I’ve made so much money investing in up and coming coins. You can trade between btc and so many altcoins. Get in on ARCO!!!\n",

      "Now, I’m not saying it will crash. However, this chart should be alarming to look at.\n",
      "Here’s what I think will happen.\n",
      "I believe there is enough people who have a sizable portion of their portfolios in cryptocurrencies. Lets say one had 50% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies. If Bitcoin sacked, then they would undoubtedly sell off the other 50%. If enough people were invested in Bitcoin, then there would be a decline in the stock markets.\n",
      "Even if only (lets say 5%) of the people in the markets were also invested in cryptocurrencies, the other 95% would see a decline in the market. Then they would start selling, thus causing a chain reaction.\n",
      "So, as you can see, even if you have nothing to do with Bitcoin, you will still be affected.\n",
      "And if Bitcoin crashes, all the other crytocurrencies would also crash.\n",
      "Also, many millennials are invested in Bitcoin. Many of these people have never invested before. If Bitcoin were to screw them over, then they would be very discouraged to ever invest again. We just lost a generation of potential investors.\n",
      "Scary Stuff.\n",
      "It’s a real shame too, because I believe that crypto is the future. If Bitcoin were to crash, I don’t think anyone would invest in a future crypto again. Perhaps crypto is the future, just not in the form of Bitcoin.\n",

It went from $2,000 to $3,000 in just 23 days, with the next two $1,000 milestones coming after 62 and 61 days respectively. Its latest milestone, the $6,000 mark, was reached only eight days after it had breached $5,000 on October 12. By Tuesday, bitcoin was trading at more than $6,500.

      "For paying for assets that are not allowed - Yes unfortunately bitcoin is often used to pay for things which are illegal.\n",
      "For speculation - Bitcoin speculation is bit like gold - it has not intrinsic utility. There is some value to it because of the aforementioned reasons which are also common with gold. Mathematically if you believe that the demand for bitcoins is going to increase more than the increase in number of bitcoins (using bitcoin mining) then maybe this is a good trade but I find that a very hard number to predict.\n",

      "There was a Norwegian man (Guardian UK article reported in 2013) who bought bought $27 of bitcoins in 2009 and they're now worth $980k. Bitcoin’s share price has been rising steadily from a fraction of a cent when first launched and now currently peaking at over $2600 (as of June 2017). Cryptocurrency and digital currency is rapidly gaining more interest and acceptance worldwide both as a financial instrument as well as culturally. Crucially after a period of volatility and downtrend, Bitcoin always emerges at a higher price- you only have to look at a long term price chart from the beginning (there is nothing else like it) Obviously at some point Bitcoin will hit a ceiling but not for a while yet. A CNBC analyst said Bitcoin could be worth 10,000 USD one day or more.\n",
      "Bitcoin isn't owned by a central authority- so no government or bank can ever shut the network down and it can't go into meltdown unlike currencies like USD, Euro which can be affected by central banks like the federal reserve or European Central bank.

      "In Q3- 2018 Bitcoin will implement the Lightning Network that will bring, among other changes, instantaneous and concurrent checks with transactions.\n",
      "The problem is that for the past year, the average number of Bitcoin transactions per second has hovered around a mean of 3. This compares to Visa’s network, which can handle closer to 3,600 transactions per second.\n",
      "And that’s not all. As the number of Bitcoin users increases, the transaction delays get even longer and the fees even higher.\n",
      "The simple reason for these low transaction volumes is that Bitcoin’s block size is capped at 1MB. The Bitcoin community is torn about increasing the cap of the block, and there are arguments to both sides.\n",
      "When Lightning becomes mainstream and is adopted by exchanges, Q3 2018, the Bitcoin price will skyrocket.\n",
      "The technology behind the Lightning Network will improve upon the process by which Bitcoin transactions are validated. Currently, the process makes use of mining rigs, requiring that computers solve complicated math problems before the transactions can be recorded on the blockchain ledger. Because of the computing power required, a single transaction can take up to an hour to confirm.\n",
      "With Lightning, however, this process would be significantly sped up. The Lightning Network would require that participants agree to transact on a separate, offline channel, and then the blockchain would update to reflect the external transaction.\n",
      "Thus, the middleman of the mining rig or digital wallet provider could be skipped entirely. The developers of the network have indicated that its speed would enable it to \"be used at retail point-of-sale terminals, with user device-to-device transactions, or anywhere instant payments are needed.\n",

More and more people will be able to use Bitcoin in everyday life, and, as the result, the price will rise. Bitcoin is the most secure storage of value, because the resources of gold are exhaustible, and we don’t know how much of it is left, while amount of Bitcoins is predetermined. There is another cryptocurrency which is going to grow in price – NGR token by Nagricoin, a project on organic fertilizers. Food is something people cannot live without; and today everybody wants to consume organic products so that to stay healthy.

      "The recent ICOs highlighted some particular weaknesses of the Ethereum platform: The Status ICO, for example, caused a major slowdown, with a backlog of transactions greater than what the network was able to process. Another ICO, Bancor’s, fueled the investor with doubt when realizing how much ETH was put in the hands of startups. Most of the companies running ICOs have very little to show as proof of their product, and will most likely sell a majority of the ETH they raised to fund their project.\n",
      "Finally, keep in mind july and august are always a bit slower than the rest of the year.\n",

      "Before then I think a lot of backers of Bitcoin Cash will slowly dump money into it to keep it somewhat comparable to Bitcoin. There might be some wild fluctuation right now and that’s because all the exchanges that have BCC/BCH wallets are not allowing withdraws or deposits. It is causing major discrepancies with prices.\n",
      "You can find BCC/BCH for .1 BTC on one exchange while its .25 BTC on another. There are pumps and dumps on each individual exchanges going on right now.\n",

      "You expend money for all the computational power for bitcoin mining hardware and associated physical resources to get some virtual money, meaningless isn’t it?\n",
      "Foreword: Bitcoin is the currency that has a theoretical limit of 21million units, which makes inflation theoretically impossible in it’s economy. Concurrently, the algorithm which is used to mine it becomes tougher and tougher the more you mine (It is said the computational effort doubles every 4 years) and it is predicted that the limit would be reached by 2041. Currently, there are approx. 17m units already mined which makes it’s economy worth a whopping 270 billion USD. I started hearing about bitcoin since 2012 when it was 7 USD, if I could and had put 1000 rupees then, it would have been 23 lakhs rupees. (Aw, snap!)\n",
      "This week (09/12/17): The current hype and rise in it’s prices are due to the announcement of opening of futures trading on Bitcoin in 2 of the Chicago’s exchanges, CME group and CBOE. Which made it highly volatile and exciting therefore. It may also in small proportions be that due to the sudden hype it got, more and more people are getting aware of the currency and want to try their luck on this magical money-making algorithm, which made it boom (without being aware of the real reason of rise) The sudden rise in it’s prices made the alleged founders of Facebook, the Winklevoss twins, the first Bitcoin billionaires ( which they made by investing 11m USD 4 years ago which they got from the lawsuit they won against Zuckerburg).\n",
      "The interesting fact is that the Chicago crytocurrency exchange CBOE works with a startup Gemini to launch the bitcoin contracts, a company founded by Winklevoss brothers themselves!\n",
      "A Bubble?: Most popular bubbles in the world have seen a pattern of intense sudden excitement, mania and hype around them. Taking examples from history, British railroads in 1840s, Internet in 1990s with the transoceanic laying of fibre-optical cables. Even the great 2008 financial crisis is pointed to the proliferation of unregulated credit derivatives creating a mortgage crisis leading to breakdown of almost all world economies. The bubble expert William Deringer said: \"Uncertainty of valuation is often a huge issue in bubbles”. That is what exactly that is happening with bitcoin right now. There is mania around. Everyone is getting to hear about it and news about bitcoin is spreading like wildfire. Bitcoin has already seen this excitement twice already, once in 2013 when it rose 5500%. All this rise is because of the uncertainty. Now with the opening of derivatives, volatility also will design the price. You expend money for all the computational power and physical resources to get virtual money that is not accepted only in the internet community, and a few products like subway and the famous the dark internet.\n",
      "See the light\n",
      "Consumers' point of view: If you make bitcoin equal to money, it will cause utter inflation in the economy with all this uncertain boom and volatility. For e.g., if a 5kg packet of rice costs .0001 bitcoin, and price of bitcoin doubles in a week, won’t it cause havoc in the society? That is the reason bitcoin won’t be accepted as a money not anywhere in the near future, not until it crashes and settles into a sustainable amount.\n",
      "Investors' point of view: As an investor in bitcoin, you really need to be aware because it has already been derided by many governments. But a small portion of your wealth could be put into this euphoric hype is definitely not bad. Who knows, it might become worth lakhs in some years.\n",
      "Traders’s point of view: As a trader, you will love all this volatility and uncertainty. Be sure, you are strong with your fundamental analysis. Be aware of what is going on around the economy day to day. You definitely can make returns in a huge scale. (better than 100% a month?).\n",

      "The current market cap of BTC is around $200 Billion. Even if BTC market cap were to rise to a mind boggling $2 Trillion, you would have only 10xd your investment. Hence I would not encourage anyone to invest in BTC (Bitcoin) at this point in time.\n",
      "Honestly in my opinion, 2018 is going to be the year of ALT COINS and 1 such Alt Coin that I am betting 75% of my crypto money on is Nebulas (NAS).\n",
      "Why Nebulas (NAS) :\n",
      "Well for starters, it is its own blockchain. This is the most misunderstood factor Im coming across. Nebulas is a 3rd generation block chain, similar to a Cardano or NEO, hence why the CEO left NEO to start Nebulas. It is very scalable, similar to the Cardano idea.\n",
      "It is adaptable. You can adapt code in the future to avoid the need to hard fork the tech if their is a problem that arrises during scaling. Think how large bitcoin's market share would be if it did not fork several times into bitcoin cash, bitcoin platinum, and so forth. It also allows you to adapt code on other platforms based off of Nebulas. So if you had an erc20(ethereum platform) built on Nebulas, you would be able to adapt the code in the future to avoid the same problem. I see this leading to mass adoption from other platforms.\n",
      "It makes the blockchain searchable. I know everyone keeps saying \"like google,\" but the reference is more to show that the relationships between blockchains, developers, and users. With Nebulas, the blockchain will be measured to determine ranks for ease of use as well as the strength of the community behind it. At the current moment you cant even search the blockchain. With Nebulas you could not only search it, but you would be able to weed out the less developed blockchains and join ones that have strong communities.\n",
      "It rewards developers. This means if you develop on Nebulas, you get PROOF OF WORK(PoW). Developers will prefer to work on nebulas not only because of its capabilities and tech, but because they will be rewarded with tokens. Everyone likes to get paid for doing things they already do.\n",
      "It has master nodes rewards. Now this may not be for everyone, but as an early investor, I hope to receive master node rewards. That means they will pay me a percentage to merely hold my Nebulas in my wallet. Something a lot of large traders are looking for. If this project grows like I think it will, I wont be selling my Nebulas at all. But the fact they will pay me to hold it, means I will be even more motivated to hold. What does this mean for the market cap? Well, it means larger traders/funds will be less likely to day trade and as the market fluctuates, Nebulas may have less fluctuation than most coins, creating a safer investments for large funds and investors to hold their money during market corrections.\n",
      "Lastly, they have already launched their testnet and will launch their mainnet (an actual working product) by March. That means they will be the first gen-3 on the blockchain. They will get first mover advantage, mass adaption, and most likely become a top 5 coin by market cap. So to go back to the original question, \"why isn't anyone talking about them?\" Well I think the team is more worried about being the first to market and flying a little under the radar, than they are marketing the project. The implications of being the first gen-3 to the market will be more than enough to launch them to the too of the crypto market. On top of that, they are not on binance, bitrex, or gdax. This leads to less awareness and trading as well. I hate to be lame, but everyone knows talk is cheap and you always watch out for the quiet ones.\n",
      "I hope this helps everyone. Also feel free to correct me if I read something wrong or anyone has any input to add. For now, Nebulas is my largest position in crypto and I will be adding to the stack as much as I can.\n",

      "Before investing in anything, you should understand what it is & how it works—most people have no idea what Bitcoin actually is. So let’s answer that question first.\n",
      "What is Bitcoin?\n",
      "Bitcoin bills itself as a true digital currency, a medium of exchange with which people from around the world can buy and sell things—without the pesky, and sometimes expensive, mediation of banks. Its primary selling points are twofold:\n",
      "1. The very nature of Blockchain technology ensures that Bitcoins can never be counterfeited, hacked, or stolen.\n",
      "2. Bitcoins cannot be “printed” arbitrarily by a central bank like US Dollars or British Pound Sterling can, and it is therefore immune to the inflationary crises that plague fiat currencies. Furthermore, the number of Bitcoins that can ever be generated (by “mining” them using computing power) is finite—there is a maximum number of Bitcoins.\n",
      "There are a number of other features which are touched on in the below video on Bitcoins. It’s short and worth the watch:\n",
      "Essentially, Bitcoin works like digital gold: it can be used to settle debts, and it has a finite limit. But Bitcoin differs from gold in one key respect: it has no intrinsic value.\n",
      "Bitcoin as an Investment\n",
      "Bitcoin isn’t a currency, and hasn’t been one since 2014 when the Internal Revenue Service deemed Bitcoin to be an asset rather than a currency with Notice 2014-21.\n",
      "Ergo, every time a Bitcoin changes hands a capital gains disposition is triggered for US tax purposes—the same thing happens whenever someone sells a stock or a house. This means that Bitcoin (in the US at least) cannot function as a currency. Bitcoin is an asset.\n",
      "Many people don’t know this, and they will be sorely disappointed when the Internal Revenue Service audits them. And those that do know are now bidding up Bitcoin’s price with the intention of flipping it for a profit, as they would any other non-yielding asset.\n",
      "For this reason, Bitcoin should be thought of not as a store of value, but as a speculative asset, like a house or a lump of gold—its price is therefore subject to the whims of traders.\n",
      "So, don’t buy Bitcoin unless you can stomach a potential loss, and have a steady hand to avoid panic selling. Likewise, don’t buy at the heights of market euphoria—only jump in when people are scared.\n",

      "However we still have not tested support of the 850 EMA. Currently at 8,965, this level should hold and effectively create a double bottom. If this occurs we can expect a massive bounce followed by a newfound bull run to test 13k and make our way back to 15k and beyond.\n",

      "Coinbase is considered the largest exchange in the world with 12 million users.\n",
      "It was created in 2012 in Sans Francisco.\n",
      "It currently serves more than 30 countries around the world, including the United States, which is not the case for many other brokers.\n",
      "Moreover, since its launch, Coinbase has helped its users to exchange more than 40 billion dollars of cryptocurrency.\n",
      "What are the payment methods and fees on Coinbase?\n",
      "On Coinbase you have several payment options. You can pay either by SEPA credit transfer, credit card or PayPal.\n",
      "The fees will be different depending on the method of payment.\n",
      "They range from 1.49% to 3.99%.\n",
      "However, if you use a credit card, the fees will be higher due to fees charged by the credit card company. And do not forget that with this payment method Coinbase takes the risk of fraudulent chargeback.\n",
      "That’s why, if you use the bank transfer, you can save around 2.5%.\n",
      "It should be noted that these fees are lower than those of many exchanges in the market.\n",
      "Is Coinbase regulated?\n",
      "Coinbase is one of the few brokers to be regulated in the United States, both federally and nationally.\n",
      "In fact, Coinbase is registered as a money services business with FinCEN. That is why he must comply with the law on bank secrecy.\n",
      "In addition, Coinbase complies with the USA Patriot Act., Which makes it consistent with state money transmission laws.\n",
      "Finally, it should be noted that Coinbase has among its investors some people or organizations that can be trusted. For example the Bank of Tokyo, the Digital Currency Group, or the co-founder of Reddit: Alexis Ohanian.\n",
      "Is Coinbase secure?\n",
      "First of all, it must be said that Coinbase separates client funds from those of the company. This means that if the broker becomes insolvent, client funds could not be claimed by his creditors and would be refunded to customers.\n",
      "In addition, 98% of cryptocurrency funds are cold-stored, ie offline.\n",
      "Digital currencies are therefore in several paper and paper wallets, which are themselves stored in safes around the world.\n",
      "All of these measures are designed to protect the funds against loss or theft by hackers.\n",
      "As for the remaining 2%, they are stored online, and are insured by the Lloyd’s Union in London.\n",
      "In the same way, US residents using a dollar portfolio on Coinbase, see their funds insured by the FDIC up to $ 250000.\n",
      "On the other hand, Coinbase uses two-factor authentication methods (2 FAs) to secure your accounts.\n",
      "It is therefore a very secure exchange.\n",
      "How to buy crypto coins on Coinbase?\n",
      "If you want to buy crypto coins on Coinbase, here is the procedure to follow.\n",
      "You will need to open an account first. For this, you will be asked for your name, your email, a password and your country of residence.\n",
      "Then you will have to choose between an individual account or a business account.\n",
      "Then you will be asked to check your phone number which will be used as a form of two-factor authentication.\n",
      "Finally, before buying your currency, you must choose your method of payment. If you wish to pay by credit card, you will need to send photos of it.\n",
      "You may also be required to verify your identity so that transactions comply with government regulations.\n",
      "You can now buy your crypto currencies. On Coinbase, you have the choice between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash.\n",

Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.

Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.\n",

      "OK, now about crypto investing (some prefer the word speculation, I don't care).\n",
      "I am not going to tell you what you should do, I am going to tell you what I do, merely for entertainment purposes, not as investment advice.\n",
      "My approach to cryptocurrencies is similar to seed investing in startups. I create portfolio of 10 - 20 cryptos, and I expect most of them to fail. But hopefully one or two will become the next big thing, and make it all worthwhile. Also I am investing only money I am 100% ready to lose, in fact I regard all my money in cryptos as lost already. Any better outcome is just pleasant surprise.\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "First I have to strongly believe that whole industry (cryptocurrencies) is disruptive and is here to stay and take over. And that belief must come from understanding, not blind wishes. For that, some studying is necessary - I read BTC whitepaper and Whitepaper of every cryptocurrency from TOP 10 by market cap to develop a strong base knowledge of the industry. I ask questions on reddit, etc. I stay clear from spam Facebook groups full of hyped up people talking about random price fluctuations.\n",
      "Then I start researching cryptocurrency by cryptocurrency. I quickly skim through the webpage. If I do not understand the key value proposition of the cryptocurrency, I write it off. I like to understand what I am buying, and there is lot of bullshit out there, with very unclear (if any) value proposition (usually anything regarding social media is bullshit).\n",
      "If I understand and like the value proposition of a coin or token, I am going to see under which blockchain is it build. Most of them are build under Ethereum. So I ask myself - does it make sense to invest in this coin? Isn’t it better to invest directly into Ethereum? How are they correlated?\n",
      "If I see the coin is priced pretty low (comparing market cap), I might go directly for the coin. If it already went up couple of hundreds or thousands of %, I might as well invest directly into ETH.\n",
      "When I decide the price is right, I am going to dig deeper - reading whitepaper, reddit boards (sometimes you find pearls like this ). I ask some hard questions -Is it inflationary and how much? Is it valuable for this project to use blockchain? Most of the services could just as well use SQL database and it wouldn’t matter. I beware of same old business disguising itself as disruptive blockchain tech. There are plenty of them.\n",
      "I pay special attention to team - who are these guys? How experienced are they? Are they fully committed or is this just a sidekick project? Especially - who are developers and how many of them is there? If I see 7 founders, and only 1–2 are devs (the rest usually being “marketing, community management, finance, sales, visionary…”) I run away.\n",
      "If the coin passes all these filters, I am going to close my eyes and buy for couple of bucks. I always only buy for as much as I can lose. I am not going to daytrade, stare into charts or panic sell. I am going to let it lie for 1–5 years, occasionally watching and reading the news about project. I also set up some sell limit order for 1/3 - 1/2 of the investment for 300% - 600% to secure a profit and freeroll if it spikes suddenly (which happens a lot here), depends on the coin and my faith in it.\n",
      "If you made it here, I will reward you with one coin I like. Warning! I do not recommend anything to anyone, this purely me saying what I like. If I said I like jumping into volcano, you surely wouldn’t jump there.\n",
      "So here it is, I like and trust TRST: Trusted Lending Circles powered by Blockchain\n",

      "I like the team - people from Google, EY, etc. They seem like they are in for realz, and not just for quick scam bucks.\n",
      "I like the price - it still haven’t been pumped crazy high, like many other good coins, and the cap is pretty low too, so I hope there is room for big growth.\n",
      "I like the project roadmap - it says that there will be many releases throughout 2017, so it will grab more attention soon. Or it will be pretty clear it failed to deliver soon (no need to wait for 5 years with this one!)\n",
      "I like the fact it’s not traded on many exchanges - that means, it is still pretty undiscovered by many hype traders…and when it will be supported by more exchanges, the price can grow significantly.\n",

      "Yes, it will. Let me share what I had learned while trading Cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "While doing Cryptocurrencies Trading, just remember 3 things in mind.\n",
      "Every Cryptocurrency that makes sudden huge spikes falls proportionately.(In order to make corrections in the price)( You already had seen that in case of Bitcoin when it falls sharply from it's all time high).\n",
      "Every coin that falls will rise eventually but it will take some time. (Have you ever seen a 60 day price chart of any coin where it's price is just falling and have no spikes??)(I haven't seen any! You can check, you won't find any)( So, the point is every coin recover in a period of 2 months max.)(In most cases, it will take a week or two. 2 months is max.)\n",
      "Don't be greedy and keep patience. The problem with people is their greed and huge thirst to earn big in lesser time and huge drive of emotions. Let me be clear, I apologise for being rude here but if you don't have patience and you can't even wait for a month while trading then, please don't indulge in Cryptocurrencies Trading. You won't make huge profit, you will only loose your hard earned money. Those who invested in bitcoin earlier are now Billionaires because of their patient nature. So, be patient and use your mind.\n",
      "Why Ripple is falling?\n",
      "There maybe some of these reasons-\n",
      "Coinbase announcement - Due to some rumors that coinbase is going to add Ripple Trading at their platform, people started buying Ripple which caused huge surge in it's price in Dec. Now when they announced that as of date there is no plan to include any other coin into coinbase, everyone started to withdraw from ripple. Seriously, ripple is doing far better than any other coin or even better than bitcoin. It took 9 years for bitcoin to become what it's today. So, how can you expect Ripple to become worth 100s of dollars in just a single month. I'm not saying that ripple will become $100 after some years, maybe, it will never become that high due to it's huge total supply of 100billion coins. So just be patient, it will rise again with far bigger spikes you haven't seen for any other altcoin.\n",
      "Due to little surge in Bitcoin price- People using sites for conversion of coins like Binance often try to convert their altcoins like ripple into Bitcoin when bitcoin price rises and their altcoin price falls. This also affect price of altcoins.\n",
      "So, just be patient and sit tight.\n",

      "The real facts about Ripple are hidden from us. Let discuss some true problems. I think, by knowing those facts you can easily find out whether you should invest in Ripple for long term or not and why it is not safe.\n",
      "There are many cryptocurrencies out there, each of which gained inspiration from bitcoin, the ancestor to them all. Bitcoin was humanity’s first definition of what it means to be a cryptocurrency, but it is a complicated creature that relies on many special functions and components. For instance, bitcoin has a decentralized block-chain ledger, on which its millions of participants organize and save a record of their transactions. It also has cryptographic hashing, so that traders can use a system of public and private keys to safeguard their identities.\n",
      "Bitcoin’s transactions are processed by miners, a supportive and incentive community that keep everything running smoothly. Relevantly, it also has a finite supply. These characteristics have made it easy to transact safely, store value, and even speculate.\n",
      "But, Ripple wasn’t designed to be a coin, or a normal cryptocurrency by the standard definition. While bitcoin and comparable cryptocurrencies give the value of the coin equal priority with network security, speed, and applicability, Ripple does away with the idea of XRP as any kind of investment asset and instead focuses on making the blockchain as strong as possible. This is primarily for the good of the institutional entities that Ripple serves, like American Express or Santander Bank. To achieve this goal, the Ripple Foundation created XRP but tweaked each traditional component of cryptocurrency into an almost unrecognizable state.\n",
      "Ripple has no mining or miners whatsoever. Instead, transactions are powered through a “centralized” blockchain to make it more reliable and fast. Mining is a core tenet of most other cryptocurrencies, and each uses their own system to determine how much power the miners have. Some, like bitcoin, use Proof-of-Work, but there is also Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Importance.\n",
      "In cryptocurrency, miners are incentivized to process network transactions with the currency itself, but this has created some issues that Ripple deems untenable. In a solution built for big banks, there should be no separate group with its own special motivations for running the network.\n",
      "While this idea has helped other cryptocurrencies to remain decentralized, it has also slowed them down: a problem Ripple cannot afford. This lack of mining affects other aspects of Ripple as well, taking it further from the standard.\n",
      "Besides processing transactions, miners are also rewarded with cryptocurrency. This is essentially how it’s created. Ripple’s exclusion of miners naturally throws a wrench into the machinery in this regard. Ripple is not finite, and can be “printed” on-demand, which makes it much more reliable for payment processing, money exchange, and other institutional activities. When it’s used, it’s simply destroyed.\n",
      "The Ripple Foundation already created the 100 billion XRP currently in circulation, giving it a stable, non-volatile character perfect for its biggest clients. However, this also removes one of the biggest factors in any true cryptocurrency: the ability to accumulate and store value as only a deflationary asset can.\n",
      "A Centralized Blockchain?\n",
      "Ripple does have a wallet, but getting access to the blockchain is tough. Retail participants aren’t supposed to have access because it introduces risky, strange elements into an otherwise sterile environment. The Ripple blockchain isn’t open like those of other cryptocurrencies. XRP can be safely stored and kept, and uses cryptography to protect participants, but the nodes it’s protecting aren’t individuals but “trusted” operators registered in the Ripple network.\n",
      "So, finally Much like the many questions surrounding bitcoin cash, even the founders of Ripple recommend not using their creation as a currency for speculation because it isn’t one. Ripple resembles a fintech platform more than anything else and has simply combined the best elements of fiat money and blockchain cryptocurrency.\n",
      "Not a “true” cryptocurrency by the standard definition, Ripple may be the dividing line that separates two distinct products to emerge from the cryptocurrency revolution: assets and solutions. While assets can serve as investments placing faith in a decentralized community and the deflationary properties of mining, solutions will dispense with the speculation and instead create platforms that are “technically” cryptocurrency, but not traditionally viewed as such.\n",
      "The price of Ripple is increasing that does not mean it is good thing for long term investment. I left these for your decision. Learn, understand then invest in it. No-one knows the future, use your wise sense of judgement.\n",
      "Don’t buy crypto-currencies in a hurry for a high price, wait for the right time. I think you have got your answer, I generally don’t get time to write here but i give most trading tips while answering questions. I thank everyone for reading my long answer.\n",

      "Is it a good time to invest money in bitcoins?\n",
      "If you have read my articles such as this, than you know my gripe with questions asking about the price of bitcoin. This question has similarities that follow the same logic. However, it is interesting because of the way it is worded. Just like the price questions, questions pertaining to the time you should invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are frequent. They are most likely the 5th or 6th most searched topic about cryptocurrency in general. Don’t quote me on that as it is conjecture.\n",
      "I need to start this topic off with a disclaimer. This is not investment advice. It is my personal opinion and should not be taken into consideration when you are investing your money. For all investment advice, you can talk to your local investment firm or financial advisor.\n",
      "It is March 2018 and I can definitively say that now is the time to start putting your money into Bitcoin. There is so much happening behind the scenes of mainstream media that it has me overwhelmed at times. I’m not talking about SEC rulings on cryptocurrency and investors either. For example, did you know that Wyoming just became a crypto compliant state? Wild, right?\n",
      "I have three main reasons that lead me to believe that it is the greenlight to invest in cryptocurrency.\n",
      "1. Low Price\n",
      "2. Natural Market Movements\n",
      "3. Institutional Adoption\n",
      "Low Price\n",
      "I believe that it is currently the time to start pumping your money into cryptocurrency because of the price it is currently at. In comparison to December 2017, Bitcoin and Ethereum are incredibly cheap. Most people that are shaky or selling bought during all time highs when price was going up. Now that it is down they are scared and trying to get rid of their coins. This is the number one way to lose all of your money fast.\n",
      "This is a small anecdote that really had me thinking. Most people I talked to said during the 19,000 USD all time high,” Man, I wish Bitcoin was only 10,000 USD. I would’ve have bought more. I should have bought when it was cheaper than 10,000.” Well, now it is well below the 10k mark and these people haven’t bought.\n",
      "Bitcoin has exploded by over 1000% even with this hard correction since 2017. Do you know of any other currency that skyrockets into those percentages even with bloodbaths? In addition, everytime Bitcoin has fallen, it has come back from the ashes twice or three times stronger. Don’t fall for the traps that bitcoin newbies fall into. Instead do what Warren Buffet advises: when people sell, buy. When people buy, sell. This leads me to my next reason\n",
      "Natural Market Movements\n",
      "People are failing to understand that we are in a natural state of correction. When you jump nearly 10,000% ROI in one year, there will be some insane drop offs involved. We are currently in one right now. There was no way that that unnatural growth would be sustained. Anybody with an inkling of financial experience could have told you that. On the other hand, people get caught up in the FOMO. It is hard to fight mob mentality when you see people’s networth suddenly grow by 5%.\n",
      "My point is this: if something dips, it must rise. I understand that this point can be refuted in many cases, but Bitcoin is not one of those cases. Bitcoin has a global community and user base in the multi-hundred millions if not over a billion. It is being used every single day to transact or as a storage of wealth. It market cap exceeds some of the biggest conglomerates in America! Just like Microsoft stocks, what goes down must one day come up. The question is where your portfolio will be when that day hits.\n",
      "Institutional Adoption\n",
      "Currently, institutional movers are pushing to put their money into cryptocurrency. Companies such as Apple, Google, and Amazon are all exploring the possibilities of blockchain technology. Some have already implemented blockchain into their currently existing systems. For example, one of the largest Chinese manufacturers of pork has put their product on the blockchain. Consumers can now directly see where they are getting their meat from, where it’s been, and which companies have touched it. As more and more blockchain technology gets developed, the price of base currencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin will rise.\n",
      "Governments like Australia and Japan are slowly embracing the idea of blockchain when it comes to social services as well. Platforms like BaaSid will revolutionize things like data protection. Their platform uses a Split ID engine that fragments and disperse data, eliminating the need for a central database. As innovations like Split ID come out, money will be increasingly put into the cryptosphere. It doesn’t even have to be shares of a coin. Things like jobs, productivity trackers, and innovative data will be created simply because they must.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      " Now is the time to be buying into cryptocurrency. Don’t be discouraged by the dips and slowdowns in the market. Look at the future and you will see that it is bright.\n",

I earned profit of 1165.56 (18$) in seven days. The bitcoin prices were shooting up like hail mary. Once they settled, I withdrew all the money from the wallet. Yesterday I again invested 10193.44 ₹ (157$) . Will invest double the amount in future, heck, I will be investing a 1000 $ from this new year because the prices are expected to shoot above 10000 $ in the new year. I have also set my eyes upon Ether. It is grabbing eyeballs as the closest competitor to Bitcoin. But the scope of investing in Ether is pretty low in India as it is still in it’s nascent stage in India as well as outside. We can invest in Ether from Blockchain. In blockchain wallet, you can buy bitcoins and convert them into ether from the app or website. Ether is rapidly growing and is poised to be the next bitcoin.

      "The future of Bitcoin is bright. There are critics and skeptics who suggest that Bitcoin is within a bubble which will burst at any given moment. I believe those people do not see the potential. There have been numerous times when people believed the bubble would burst (e.g during the hard forks). Each time the price of Bitcoin decreased, only to surge up again break its previous record price.\n",
      "The value of Bitcoin has increased 1,300% in a year - that is insane growth!\n",
      "So, I say invest in Bitcoin! Financial researchers indicate that it will just keep growing, so its price is actually still relatively low.\n",
      "Before investing I always warn people to be careful though. If you want to invest in Bitcoin you need to understand it and Blockchain.\n",
      "First thing to do though before joining or investing anything is to check for scams! Take my word for it, I have made mistakes when I first started with Bitcoin - there are a lot of scams out there. So be smart, read reviews before you invest anything. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. (e.g hundreds of dollars in returns weekly for a small investment).\n",
      "A good place to start checking for scams and opportunities is Coindesk.\n",
      "If you want to join Cloud mining pools, I would personally suggest Hashflare. I have had really good results with their system.\n",
      "“HashFlare works similar to other cloud mining operations. ... Pools: HashFlare's miners are connected to different pools. The company encourages users to find the most profitable combination. Payout: All mined cryptocurrency is distributed among all HashFlare customers according to their share of hashrate.”\n",
      "This is the same as all other mining pools and they have been active for a quite a while (since 2013). This is an indication that they are legit, as most scam mining pools close within a year. This is because they steal the money so new investors don’t get any payouts and only early investors benefit (ponzi scheme).\n",
      "My experience with Hashflare over the past year has been great. I invested a small amount of $150 and the ROI has been 300% within a year! Just a note, once you have invested, you can only withdraw your earnings once it reaches 0.01btc or 0.1eth (+-$150). View it as a short-term profitable investment and leave it to grow as Bitcoin’s value also increases.\n",
      "My next suggestion for investing in Bitcoin would be Bitbond. I have had some great results over the past year.\n",
      "They specialize in allowing people to invest or take small, short-term loans. It is aimed at small business owners and people with Bitcoin who want to to make micro-investements to help people succeed.\n",
      "Bitbond is “a peer-to-peer bitcoin lending gives individual investors access profitable interest rates. At the same time borrowers get small business loans quickly and in an uncomplicated way. Bitbond leverages bitcoin as a technology and payment network to create the first global market for small business loans. That's something that wouldn't be possible in the conventional banking system because payment transactions would take too long and would be too expensive.”\n",
      "I started off by investing a small amount of Bitcoin ($60) into two loans. In just over 6 months I had doubled my money in returns and the 1 loan wasn’t even completely paid off yet. This allowed me to reinvest in two other loans.\n",
      "In terms of trading, I love to use Whaleclub. Whaleclub is trading platform that has made it easy to trade with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

The demand will be more than the available bitcoin in the market. The price will rise sharply. The same thing is going no now so Bitcoin price is rising.\n",
      "“ Bitcoin is not anonymous. If you have thought that people are buying bitcoin because it is anonymous then it will be wrong as there are other altcoin (like dashcoin) in the market which is more anonymous than Bitcoin.

      "Now if the price did not rise sharply then miners will not be interested in mining as it will give them a loss. This will happen because there will be higher difficulties in mining which will increase the production cost of Bitcoin. But as the Bitcoin market price is down no one will be interested in mining. And in this case Bitcoin will take more time to get one confirmation or it will be never confirmed. People need to give more mining fees. And one day may come when the mining fees may be more than money exchange and bank transfer fees. Finally the same problem returns.\n",

      "– Looking at the latest developments and increasing interest towards the XRP, by the end of 2018, the Ripple price is expected to cross the $7 barrier at least.\n",
      "– Trading Volume of XRP is nowhere close to the most popular cryptocurrencies, BTC and ETH. Trading volume is expected to grow in 2018, and a rise in speculative activity on the Ripple cryptocurrency can even raise its prices to $7-$10 mark as well.\n",
      "– Though the overall price of XRP is expected to witness an upsurge, not all months of 2018 will be the same. A lot of cryptocurrency enthusiasts don’t like the idea of banks or any financial institution or a company regulating the cryptocurrency. In the long run and as long as banks exist, XRP is likely to prove as a solid investment, but its prices can see a downward trend in some of the months.\n",
      "If you want to invest in XRP for quick gains within a few months to an year, it seems promising. In 2018, it is expected to see a sharp upsurge in prices. It is projected to cross the one dollar mark at the very least.\n",
      "The price of a single Ripple was hovering around the 70 to 85 cents region. It was at $3.8 and now is back at $0.92 after it was close to $1 on the 10th of March 2018! What I can say is that it can easily go back to $3,8 since in the last few weeks from total market cap almost 150 billion USD disappeared. If those big players come again into the game it can even go to $5. You can do the math by yourself using the number of coins, the price and the market cap. Is hard to go higher, because at $7 the capitalisation would be higher than bitcoin.\n",

For example a Core 2 PC can do about 3-30 Megahash a second, an ASIC about 3 terrahash a second. This is 100,000 to 1 million times faster. So you need a million or so basic CPU devices to equal one modern ASIC miner.\n",

Bitcoin allows a successful transaction between two parties without any intermediary such as bank, credit card company or other financial institution. Bitcoin enables most secure, fast, and cost-effective border less money transfer. When it come to owning bitcoin or any other crypto currency in India, things are not easy. Why is this so? Simply because there is not much information available about bitcoin exchange in India.\n",
      "What is Bitcoin exchange?\n",
      "Bitcoin exchanges or cryptocurrency exchanges are the companies that allows you to buy or sell of digital currencies for other assets such as fiat(dollar,INR, euro, etc.) currency. Most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in India deals with bitcoin, ether, ripple, and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin exchanges have become most common in India due to increasing bitcoin awareness.\n",
      "How does cryptocurrency exchange works\n",
      "Cryptocurrency exchanges enable trading by creating a spread of buy and sell orders, where spread refers to the difference between these two orders. The cryptocurrency exchanges keep the buying price slightly higher than its selling price. The exchanges make profit by compensating in the buy and sell orders. Some of the exchanges also charge extra withdrawal fees which seems small, however profits made are significant due to huge customer base.\n",
      "So for our Indian readers, I am listing out the popular bitcoin exchanges in India, where you can buy and sell Bitcoin and other crypto currencies.

      "\n",
      "At this point in history, most people have heard about Bitcoin. They vaguely understand that it is digital currency, and they may even be aware that there are other cryptocurrencies, tokens, and coins. Another bit of popular knowledge is that if one were to have invested in Bitcoin in late 2012 (when it was $12), that same coin would be worth almost $4,388 today.\n",
      "Many people have already struck it rich on Bitcoin and other currencies, causing some people to think that they missed the boat. Fortunately, there is a good argument that this is not the case. I’ll lay out my perspective below.\n",
      "Full disclosure, I have invested more money in cryptocurrencies within the past four weeks than in any point prior. This is partially because of resources and awareness, but I still maintain that there are unique opportunities available today that can create incredible returns for investors. Here’s why.\n",
      "The Cryptocurrency Market Capacity Will Grow. At the time of this writing, all of the money in Bitcoin and all of the other hundreds of coins amounts to just under $100 billion. Let’s contrast this with the trillions of dollars invested in Dot Com companies before the 1990’s bubble. Right now, it’s hard to buy Bitcoin, as pointed out by Brock Pierce of Blockchain Capital. Sources like Coinbase cannot keep up with demand for new accounts, and other options require some tech savvy. This will gradually change. When your grandpa can invest in crypto, expect the coins of today to gain enormous value.\n",
      "The SEC Determined That Cryptocurrencies Are Securities.Last month, the SEC finally decided to list cryptocoins as securities, just like stocks. Owners for Bitcoin and other coins will have to pay capital gains just as they would with stocks. Some crypto enthusiasts fear that this regulation will be a damper on the community, but I think the opposite is true. By regulating crypto, the SEC is further legitimizing it, helping to ensure its long term future. Also, this move means that buying cryptocurrencies is, technically, an investment and not a speculation (though it still has characteristics of both).\n",
      "Altcoin Technologies Are in Their Infancy. Bitcoin is constantly evolving. It will continue to do so in the future. Newer currencies like Ethereum are evolving more fundamentally and more quickly. Even newer coins like NEO and Golem barely have a technological basis for their value, but are being developed at an incredible pace. This makes their price low and their potential upside great (though risky). Not all of the hundreds of coins on the market are worth your money. Not all of them will succeed. But some will, and they’ll make smart investors rich in the process.\n",
      "Bitcoin is the king of the cryptocurrencies. It is very expensive, but there is reason to believe it will continue to gain value. Many other coins are on the rise in its wake. Don’t listen to the people who say the bubble has popped. There are strong arguments that this is only the beginning.\n",

      "One of my friends, was much into share markets and other types of trading, In 2012 she had invested just Rs5000 in bitcoins, later on her money turned to 15000, she had withdrawn Rs5000 from it and let the remaining Rs10000 grow.

      "My technique is for al my investment more or less the same. I buy for max $500 a investmentvehicle. If the vehicle can go to zero, like stocks or Bitcoin, I will never buy more if the price go down and I do not sell with loss. If the vehicle cannot go to zero, like fisical silver I will buy every month more of it for a small amound of money. If the price go up, I will sell for $500 and have some stocks of Bitcoin for free.\n",
      "Examples\n",
      "I buy 1 bitcoin for $1000. I keep it until the price is $1100. I sell 0.9 Bitcoin. I receive $990 and have 0.1 Bitcoin for the price of $10 or close to zero.\n",

      "An other advice I always give is to buy each month 1 ounce of FYSICAL silver and keep it until the day you retire. In the long run you will have profits. You will not easely sell the silver for other purposes (very important), so you will have your one retirementcapital, even if it is a relatively small som of money. If you are 20 years of age, you have lived for 240 month and you should have 240 ounces of fysical silver. One ounce of silver cost now more or less $20, so you should not feel the buy in your budget, even if you have to buy two ounces for the next 240 month, because you start to late with that idee.\n",

The maximum block size is 10MB when Bitcoin’s is 1MB, and the price is about only USD 20.

That is un-hackable. The issue is that when you trade there are actually no transactions going on, its just the data that changes. For example when you trade some ethereum for Bitcoin, no transfer takes place, the system just writes down that out of the huge wallet, some Bitcoin belongs to your account. So when you go and withdraw the BTC, the exchange verifies how much in the wallet is actually yours. THIS is where the hacks happen. This system is blockchain independent and hence can be hacked.

Miners don’t care about what transactions made, where they are from or headed to, or how much is being transacted. They only care about the fees they are paid. By this logic, if a hacker wanted to drain the funds from an exchange, nothing would stop them as the miners would treat their transaction like any other.

      "Freedom in Payment / Instant Transactions: With Bitcoin it is very possible to be able to send and get money anywhere in the world at any given time. You don’t have to worry about crossing borders, rescheduling for bank holidays, or any other limitations one might think will occur when transferring money.\n",
      "Control and Security: Cryptocurerncies are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by the sender, as with credit card charge-backs. Allowing users to be in control of their transactions help keep Bitcoin safe for the network. Payments in Bitcoin can be made and finalized without one’s personal information being tied to the transactions. Due to the fact that personal information is kept hidden from prying eyes, Bitcoin protects against identity theft.\n",
      "Very Low Fees: Currently there are either no fees, or very low fees within Bitcoin payments. With transactions, users might include fees in order to process the transactions faster. The higher the fee, the more priority it gets within the network and the quicker it gets processed.\n",
      "Information is Transparent: With the block chain, all finalized transactions are available for everyone to see, however personal information is hidden. Your public address is what is visible; however, your personal information is not tied to this. Anyone at anytime can verify transactions in the Bitcoin block chain.\n",
      "Fewer Risks for Merchants: Due to the fact that Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed, do not carry with them personal information, and are secure, merchants are protected from potential losses that might occur from fraud.\n",
      "MOST IMPORTANT. YOU OWN IT: There is no other electronic cash system in which your account isn’t owned by someone else. Take PayPal, for example: if the company decides for some reason that your account has been misused, it has the power to freeze all of the assets you have in the account, without consulting you. It is then up to you to jump through whatever hoops that are necessary to get it cleared, so that you can access your funds. Remember: YOUR FUNDS! With cryptocurrency, you own the private key and the corresponding public key that makes up your cryptpcurrency address. No one can take that away from you (unless you lose it yourself, or host it with a web-based wallet service that loses it for you).\n",

      "The benefits of cryptocurrency over current fiat currency tech\n",
      "Example: Central governments can’t take it away\n",
      "Remember what happened in Cyprus in March 2013? The Central Bank wanted to take back uninsured deposits larger than $100,000 to help recapitalize itself, causing huge unrest in the local population. It originally wanted to take a percentage of deposits below that figure, eating directly into family savings. That can’t happen with cryptocurrency/bitcoin. Because the currency is decentralized, you own it. No central authority has control, and so a bank can’t take it away from you. For those who find their trust in the traditional banking system unravelling, that’s a big benefit.\n",
      "Let’s take a look at some of the improvements that can be made to fiat currency by shifting towards digital cash:\n",
      "ADVANTAGES OF CRYPTOCURRENCY\n",
      "Fraud: Cryptocurerncies are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by the sender, as with credit card charge-backs.\n",
      "Identity Theft: When you give your credit card to a merchant, you give him or her access to your full credit line, even if the transaction is for a small amount. Credit cards operate on a “pull” basis, where the store initiates the payment and pulls the designated amount from your account. Cryptocurrency use a “push” mechanism that allows the cryptocurrency holder to send exactly what he or she wants to the merchant or recipient with no further information\n",
      "Immediate Settlement: Purchasing real property typically involves a number of third parties (Lawyers, Notary), delays, and payment of fees. In many ways, the bitcoin/cryptocurency blockchain is like a “large property rights database,” says Gallippi. Bitcoin contracts can be designed and enforced to eliminate or add third party approvals, reference external facts, or be completed at a future date or time for a fraction of the expense and time required to complete traditional asset transfers.\n",
      "Access to Everyone: There are approximately 2.2 billion individuals with access to the Internet or mobile phones who don’t currently have access to traditional exchange systems. These individuals are primed for the Crytocurrency market. Kenya’s M-PESA system, a mobile phone-based money transfer and micros financing service recently announced a bitcoin device, with one in three Kenyans now owning a bitcoin wallet. (Let me repeat that again. 1/3)\n",
      "Lower Fees: There aren’t usually transaction fees for cryptocurrency exchanges because the miners are compensated by the network (Side note: This is the case for now). Even though there’s no bitcoin/cryptocurrency transaction fee, many expect that most users will engage a third-party service, such as Coinbase, creating and maintaining their own bitcoin wallets. These services act like Paypal does for cash or credit card users, providing the online exchange system for bitcoin, and as such, they’re likely to charge fees. It’s interesting to note that Paypal does not accept or transfer bitcoins.\n",
      "MOST IMPORTANT. YOU OWN IT\n",
      "There is no other electronic cash system in which your account isn’t owned by someone else. Take PayPal, for example: if the company decides for some reason that your account has been misused, it has the power to freeze all of the assets held in the account, without consulting you (Trust me, this has happen to me many times) It is then up to you to jump through whatever hoops are necessary to get it cleared, so that you can access your funds. With cryptocurrency, you own the private key and the corresponding public key that makes up your cryptpcurrency address. No one can take that away from you (unless you lose it yourself, or host it with a web-based wallet service that loses it for you).\n",
      "THE BAD THINGS ABOUT CRYPTOCURRENCY\n",
      "Overall, cryptocurrencies have a long way to go before they can replace credit cards and traditional currencies as a tool for global commerce.\n",
      "Bottom Line: Cryptocurrency is a baby. It will needs years and years of exposure to the global system, before the masses start accepting it.\n",

      "Businesses need to start accepting it\n",
      "They need to make it easier to sign up and get started.\n",
      "HIGH RISK OF LOSS\n",
      "Timothy B. Lee, adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and regular contributor to Forbes, identifies four reasons to be cautious about bitcoins:\n",
      "Lack of Security. There is no safety net or perfect way to protect your bitcoins from human error (passwords), technical glitches (hard drive failures, malware), or fiduciary fraud. According to an article in the UK edition of Wired, 18 of 40 web-based businesses offering to exchange bitcoins into other fiat currencies have gone out of business, with only six exchanges reimbursing their customers. The authors of the study estimate that the median lifespan of any bitcoin exchange is 381 days, with a 29.9% chance that a new exchange will close within a year of opening.\n",
      "Increased Regulation. While relatively benign guidelines are currently in place, law enforcement agencies could decide that bitcoins are a “giant money laundering scheme,” and enact more stringent regulations that would diminish the currency’s value.\n",
      "Limited Scaling. The design of the system limits the speed and number of transactions processed, making it unlikely that bitcoins will replace conventional credit card transactions.\n",
      "Lack of Applications. While acknowledging bitcoins’ popular use for illegal transactions, Lee questions how useful bitcoins really are. To be truly disruptive to existing fiat currencies or electronic payment systems, Bitcoin would need applications for low-cost international money transfers, the creation of complex electronic contracts, or use in Kickstarter-style fundraising campaigns or micropayment transfers.\n",
      "FINAL THOUGHTS\n",
      "There are always pros and cons to any situation in life. To be able to make a good decision, you need to weigh the good and bad thoroughly before finalizing your choice. With Cryptocurrency, it’s more about mass acceptance than technology. The technology is here. Only time will tell when the rest of the world (governments, citizens) will say… YES!\n",

      "Investopedia provides the following answer to your question:\n",
      "Due to the unique nature of virtual currencies, there are some inherent advantages to transacting through Bitcoin that users of other currencies do not get. Digital currencies are a relatively new and untested medium of exchange, and users should be careful to weigh their benefits and risks. That said, Bitcoin appears to offer some unique possibilities.\n",
      "What Is Bitcoin?\n",
      "Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, \"cryptocurrency\" system designed to allow online users to process transactions through digital units of exchange called Bitcoins. Started in 2009 by a mysterious programmer, Bitcoin has generated plenty of interest and controversy as a \"third\" type of currency and an alternative to government flat currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro or pure commodity currencies like gold or silver coins.\n",
      "Bitcoin payments are processed through a private network of computers linked through a shared program. Each transaction is simultaneously recorded in a \"blockchain\" on each computer that updates and informs all accounts.\n",
      "Bitcoins are either \"mined\" by a computer through a process of solving increasingly complex mathematical algorithms or purchased with standard national money currencies and placed into a \"Bitcoin wallet\" that is accessed through a smartphone or computer.\n",
      "User Anonymity\n",
      "Bitcoin purchases are discrete. Unless a user voluntarily publishes his Bitcoin transactions, his purchases are never associated with his personal identity, much like cash-only purchases, and cannot be traced back to him. In fact, the anonymous Bitcoin address that is generated for user purchases changes with each transaction.\n",
      "No Third-party Interruptions\n",
      "One of the most widely publicized benefits of Bitcoin is that governments, banks and other financial intermediaries have no way to interrupt user transactions or place freezes on Bitcoin accounts. The system is purely peer-to-peer; users experience a greater degree of freedom than with national currencies.\n",
      "Purchases Are Not Taxed\n",
      "Since there is no way for third parties to identify, track or intercept transactions that are denominated in Bitcoins, one of the major advantages of Bitcoin is that sales taxes are not added onto any purchases.\n",
      "Very Low Transaction Fees\n",
      "Standard wire transfers and foreign purchases typically involve fees and exchange costs. Since Bitcoin transactions have no intermediary institutions or government involvement, the costs of transacting are kept very low. This can be a major advantage for travelers. Additionally, any transfer in Bitcoins happens very quickly, eliminating the inconvenience of typical authorization requirements and wait periods.\n",
      "Mobile Payments\n",
      "Like with many online payment systems, Bitcoin users can pay for their coins anywhere they have Internet access. This means that purchasers never have to travel to a bank or a store to buy a product. However, unlike online payments made with U.S. bank accounts or credit cards, personal information is not necessary to complete any transaction.\n",

      "The best exchanges for trading the majority of altcoins are EtherDelta, Binance, and Bittrex.\n",
      "This answer will be quite short as it is very easy to explain. Exchanges are platforms where you can buy, sell, and hold CryptoCurrency. As there are over 1200 CryptoCurrencies to date, keeping track of where to trade all of these CryptoCurrencies may get a little complex.\n",
      "To find these exchanges, all you have to do is go onto CoinMarketCap. Select the altcoin you wish to trade and go into the “Markets” tab. Here you will see a list of all the markets the specific coin is traded on.\n",
      "For this example, we will show some of the markets for the coin NEO. As you can see, the highest volume pairs for NEO are Binance and Bittrex. Ignore Bitfinex as they have manipulated trading on their exchange.\n",
      "There are two key metrics that you should look at for when determining whether or not an exchange is worth trading on. These metrics are, in no particular order:\n",
      "Market Capitalization\n",
      "Volume\n",
      "Market Capitalization is the total dollar market value of a CryptoCurrency. The price of a coin multiplied by the supply.\n",
      "Volume is the amount of money exchanged in a CryptoCurrency in a time period. The culmination of all trades, bids and asks for typically a 24 hour interval.\n",
      "Once you have narrowed down a coin you would like to trade, you should follow the steps of checking the markets it is on, market capitalization, and volume. Right now, one of these three exchanges, Binance, is having a bonus partner program which allows you to get extra CryptoCurrency in order to encourage mainstream adoption. Binance from an honest opinion is a new cutting edge exchange that any new or experienced CryptoCurrency investor and trader alike should start to use.\n",
      "So if you’re looking to find an exchange to buy the majority of altcoins, Binance is your best bet. Hopefully this answer helped, upvoting will help others as well, and if you want more insight on CryptoCurrency you can follow me!\n",

      "Now, I’ll explain, How you can make money through only $100? If you’re thinking that’s impossible, don’t read this answer below this line. I can give 100% guarantee that, you can make a tonne of money through only an investment of $100!\n",
      "If you have invested $100–$1000, you will get your capital + interest back only after 299 days, that's the policy of this Bitcoin.\n",
      "The below pic can explain you nicely.\n",
      "The below pic is the interest they have paid who all have invested.\n",
      "This below pic shows that, If you had invested $100, you would have made $365 for span of 299 days at an average of 0.89% of interest. This interest changes daily as you can see the above pic.\n",
      "Still you haven’t applied the compound interest. Once you read about the compound interest, definitely you are gonna invest. Below you can get more information about the compound interest.\n",
      "Suppose the daily interest you getting was 0.9% of $100, it would be 0.9$ daily earning.\n",
      "You may get daily interest of 1% also\n",
      "Now I’ll explain you, How the Compound Interest works? based on the above example.\n",
      "You can only reinvest the interest amount only in the multiples of 10. Thats their policy.\n",
      "READ CAREFULLY…\n",
      "If you add daily interest of $0.9 for the span of 12 days, it would be 10.80$.\n",
      "It took 12 days to make 10.80$.\n",
      "Now you have money in the multiple of 10.\n",
      "Now, you can reinvest $10 into the invested amount i.e $100, it will be $110.\n",
      "So, you’re invested amount now became $110.\n",
      "At the interest of 0.9% for the amount of $110, your daily earning will be now $0.99.\n",
      "So to make a multiples of $10, it will take now 10 days. Now, if we reinvest the $10 into the reinvested amount i.e $110, it will be now $120.\n",
      "We can see that, for making $10 the number of days are decreasing i.e from 12 days to 10 days.\n",
      "If we calculate the invested amount of $120 with the 0.9% of interest, you’ll be getting now 1.08$.\n",
      "The amount of $10 getting daily interest will go on decreasing, at one day you’ll be earning $10 interest daily. If you continue to reinvest, you’ll be earning $100 daily interest and the list goes on and on… THIS IS HOW COMPOUND INTEREST WORKS\n",

      "Isn't it amazing if tell you that you can print your own money ? Yes, you can create your own bitcoins and as much as you want and this can be done using you hardware or cloud services .\n",
      "Hardware Based Mining\n",
      "In the initials days of Bitcoin mining , it was easily mined using the CPU . As the miners increased , to use more hash rates people started using GPU and now ASIC. I am not going into the details on how this works in the background , you can refer to this Bitcoin mining if you want to know the science behind it.\n",
      "CPU/GPU Mining\n",
      "You can use the hashrate of your own computer to mine bitcoins. But due to huge number of miners , difficulty of blockchain and high hash rates of ASIC its nearly impossible to mine Bitcoin for profitability. How can you compete with your 100H/s against 1TH/s ? If you have free electricity then you can get some sort of profit. Where as you can mine Altcoins or Alternative Cryptocurrencies such as Monero , Bytecoins , DASH , Ethereum etc. You can wait for them to turn into Gold or you can convert them to Bitcoin using Cryptonator.\n",
      "All you need to do is Register,Download Minergate GUI Miner for Windows/Linux and start mining. They also offer “Smart Miner” which automatically mines altcoins based on current exchange rates.\n",
      "Any Monero / Ethereum contract will give you 80% + Return on Investment and this is one of the reasons why huge number people are joining the mining business.\n",

      "3. Storing Bitcoins\n",
      "Now the most important thing is storing the bitcoins. There are really security concerns about storing the bitcoins. Major exchanges have been hacked , bitcoins worth millions were stolen. Tokyo based Mt Gox was hacked and 350 million$ was stolen , 78 million $ was stolen from Hong Kong based Bitfinex and there are thousands of stories of personal bitcoin thefts due insecure handling of private key. There are hundreds of hackers who are working day and night to break into systems , hack the servers or hack your account. All they need is your private key, either by hacking your account or by hacking the server.\n",
      "So , the first and foremost rule never keep all your bitcoins in your one pocket , DISTRIBUTE THEM among different wallets.\n",
      "Avoid keeping bitcoins in exchanges as they are more prone to cyber attack , put them in wallets.\n",
      "If your amount is small and you are interested in Trading keep it in Hot Wallets (Online Wallets) like Blockchain , Xapo etc.\n",
      "For the hot wallets, Always use the highest form of security available by the wallets , like SMS based authentication or Google 2 Factor Authentication or Finger Print Authentication.\n",
      "You can also keep your bitcoins on Windows / Android based software such as Copay , Mycelium Wallet etc.\n",
      "If you have more bitcoins and want to keep it ultrasafe then go for Hardware wallets like KeepKey , TREZOR which is available at only 58$. is definitely the best choice.\n",

      "General information:\n",
      "All 3 services contracts are lifetime, what means that they will work until the cost of mined coins is higher than maintenance fee.\n",
      "If profit became less than maintenance fee, HashFlare will continue to work 21 days, Genesis-Mining- 60 days, haven't found information about Hashing24 in such situation. But this situation can happens only if bitcoin will fall more than twice in price while it's difficulty will stay same, that doesn't looks like much possible in near future.\n",
      "You can use your bitcoins or debit/credit cards to pay for services.\n",
      "HashFlare LiteCoin mining idiomatically convert income to bitcoins, that why it placed in the same table with bitcoin services. It now a bit less profitable than was before, but still interesting idea to diversification investments.\n",
      "General conclusions:\n",
      "If you want to try with minimum size investment - your choose is HashFlare - their contract is just $1.2 cost.\n",
      "On longer time Genesis-Mining looks most effective because of less maintenance cost, but in long time perspective difficulty of mining will increase and it looks better idea to buy more power on HashFlare and win in shorter time distance.\n",
      "If you want more diversification, than you can use Hashing24 as well.\n",
      "PS: Don’t forget, that crypto-currencies have volatile prices and therefore are quite risky investments. Mining difficulty increases and mining becomes less profitable over time. Don’t invest more than you ready to loose in the worst scenario!\n",

      "Direct Online TradesIn direct online trading, you create a trade advertisement including the amount of bitcoins you’re willing to sell. And then you just need to post it on a trading website. There are hundreds of websites over the internet that let you create trade ads to help you boost your sales. Also, don’t forget to use Escrow service to ensure a safe and secure trading experience.\n",
      "Online Bitcoin ExchangesTrading through online exchanges is getting more and more popular. It is perhaps, the easiest way to sell your bitcoins. The online bitcoin exchanges act as an intermediary, holding funds of the exchanging parties. First of all, you need to go through an identity verification process but after that, it’s all very simple. And the best part is, you don’t have to do the rest of the work like organizing sales. After the identity verification, you have to place a ‘sell’ order specifying the amount of bitcoins you want to sell and also the price per unit as per your needs. As soon as someone places a ‘buy’ order that matches the amount of your ‘sell’ order, the exchange takes place and the amount is credited to your account in the desired currency. In case you want to buy a certain amount of bitcoins, you’ll need to place a ‘buy order’ in the same way.\n",

      "We’re sitting on a park bench. It’s a great day.\n",
      "I have one apple with me. I give it to you.\n",
      "You now have one apple and I have zero.\n",
      "That was simple, right?\n",
      "Let’s look closely at what happened:\n",
      "My apple was physically put into your hand.\n",
      "You know it happened. I was there. You were there. You touched it.\n",
      "We didn’t need a third person there to help us make the transfer. We didn’t need to pull in Uncle Tommy (who’s a famous judge) to sit with us on the bench and confirm that the apple went from me to you.\n",
      "The apple’s yours! I can’t give you another apple because I don’t have any left. I can’t control it anymore. The apple left my possession completely. You have full control over that apple now. You can give it to your friend if you want, and then that friend can give it to his friend. And so on.\n",
      "So that’s what an in-person exchange looks like. I guess it’s really the same, whether I’m giving you a banana, a book, or say a quarter, or a dollar bill….\n",
      "But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n",
      "Back to apples!\n",
      "Now say, I have one digital apple. Here, I’ll give you my digital apple.\n",
      "Ah! Now it gets interesting.\n",
      "How do you know that that digital apple that used to be mine, is now yours, and only yours? Think about it for a second.\n",
      "It’s more complicated, right? How do you know that I didn’t send that apple to Uncle Tommy as an email attachment first? Or your friend Joe? Or my friend Lisa too?\n",
      "Maybe I made a couple of copies of that digital apple on my computer. Maybe I put it up on the internet and one million people downloaded it.\n",
      "As you see, this digital exchange is a bit of a problem. Sending digital apples doesn’t look like sending physical apples.\n",
      "Some brainy computer scientists actually have a name for this problem: it’s called the double-spending problem. But don’t worry about it. All you need to know is that, it’s confused them for quite some time and they’ve never solved it.\n",
      "Until now.\n",
      "But let’s try to think of a solution on our own.\n",
      "Ledgers\n",
      "Maybe these digital apples need to be tracked in a ledger. It’s basically a book where you track all transactions — an accounting book.\n",
      "This ledger, since it’s digital, needs to live in its own world and have someone in charge of it.\n",
      "Say, just like World of Warcraft. Blizzard, the guys who created the online game, have a “digital ledger” of all the rare flaming fire swords that exist in their system. So, cool, someone like them could keep track of our digital apples. Awesome — we solved it!\n",
      "Problems\n",
      "There’s a bit of a problem though:\n",
      "1) What if some guy over at Blizzard created more? He could just add a couple of digital apples to his balance whenever he wants!\n",
      "2) It’s not exactly like when we were on the bench that one day. It was just you and me then. Going through Blizzard is like pulling in Uncle Tommy(a third-party) out of court(did I mention he’s a famous judge?) for all our park bench transactions. How can I just hand over my digital apple to you, like, you know— the usual way?\n",
      "Is there any way to closely replicate our park bench, just you-and-me, transaction digitally? Seems kinda tough…\n",
      "The Solution\n",
      "What if we gave this ledger — to everybody? Instead of the ledger living on a Blizzard computer, it’ll live in everybody’s computers. All the transactions that have ever happened, from all time, in digital apples will be recorded in it.\n",
      "You can’t cheat it. I can’t send you digital apples I don’t have, because then it wouldn’t sync up with everybody in the system. It’d be a tough system to beat. Especially if it got really big.\n",
      "Plus it’s not controlled by one person, so I know there’s no one that can just decide to give himself more digital apples. The rules of the system were already defined at the beginning. And the code and rules are open-source—you know, kinda like the software used in your mom’s Android phone. Or kinda like Wikipedia. It’s there for the smart people to contribute to, maintain, secure, improve on, and check on.\n",
      "You could participate in this network too and update the ledger and make sure it all checks out. For the trouble, you could get like 25 digital apples as a reward. In fact, that’s the only way to create more digital apples in the system.\n",
      "I simplified quite a bit\n",
      "…but that system I explained exists. It’s called the Bitcoin protocol. And those digital apples are the “bitcoins” within the system. Fancy!\n",
      "So, did you see what happened? What does the public ledger enable?\n",
      "1) It’s open source remember? The total number of apples was defined in the public ledger at the beginning. I know the exact amount that exists. Within the system, I know they are limited(scarce).\n",
      "2) When I make an exchange I now know that digital apple certifiably left my possession and is now completely yours. I used to not be able to say that about digital things. It will be updated and verified by the public ledger.\n",
      "3) Because it’s a public ledger, I didn’t need Uncle Tommy(third-party) to make sure I didn’t cheat, or make extra copies for myself, or send apples twice, or thrice…\n",
      "Within the system, the exchange of a digital apple is now just like the exchange of a physical one. It’s now as good as seeing a physical apple leave my hand and drop into your pocket. And just like on the park bench, the exchange involved two people only. You and me — we didn’t need Uncle Tommy there to make it valid.\n",
      "In other words, it behaves like a physical object.\n",
      "But you know what’s cool? It’s still digital. We can now deal with 1,000 apples, or 1 million apples, or even .0000001 apples. I can send it with a click of a button, and I can still drop it in your digital pocket if I was in Nicaragua and you were all the way in New York.\n",
      "I can even make other digital things ride on top of these digital apples! It’s digital after-all. Maybe I can attach some text on it — a digital note. Or maybe I can attach more important things; like say a contract, or a stock certificate, or an ID card…\n",
      "So this is great! How should we treat or value these “digital apples”? They’re quite useful aren’t they?\n",
      "Well, a lot of people are arguing over it now. There’s debate between this and that economic school. Between politicians. Between programmers. Don’t listen to all of them though. Some people are smart. Some are misinformed. Some say the system is worth a lot, some say it’s actually worth zero. Some guy actually put a hard number: $1,300 per apple. Some say it’s digital gold, some a currency. Other say they’re just like tulips. Some people say it’ll change the world, some say it’s just a fad.\n",
      "I have my own opinion about it.\n",
      "That’s a story for another time though. But kid, you now know more about Bitcoin than most.\n",

      "Soorya Nath\n",
      "Reason is simple, when our government looks at bitcoins, they are incapable of tracing any person or company holding responsibility for Bitcoin not only in their jurisdiction, but in the entire planet!\n",
      "Legal Implication : In order to recognise any medium as authorised payment and settlement system, they should have proper licences from Reserve/Central Bank of the respective country. So that government can ensure all the preventive measures against fraud , money laundering and any antisocial activity .\n",
      "When a case is filed against Bitcoin, not the people transacting bitcoins, inside the jurisdiction, governments cannot be able to perform their legal obligation to the society !\n",

      "it becomes very much difficult for governments to audit transactions, and perform their obligations .\n",
      "This is the second part.\n",
      "How government can make Bitcoins a legal form of payment and settlement in their jurisdiction ?\n",
      "Governments have to provide bitcoin infrastructure in their jurisdiction, so that they can keep the network going. Just like operating banks, it will cost a large sum of money.\n",
      "Governments can pass a law enacting all the citizens to update their bitcoin address to the existing identification medium so that governments can trace the transactions.\n",

      "Bitcoin may fail at some point in the future, it has still created a discussion in economic circles that could potentially advance the entire monetary theory in general. The failure of one crypto-currency, even if it is the most successful one, does not mean the entire economic theory surrounding these currencies is invalid.\n",
      "There will be lots of drama, people who have heavily invested their fiat currency into Bitcoin will lose lots of money, and then development will begin on the next big crypto-currency. Economics and mechanics are two entirely different things. The fact that people are actually creating these coins means that crypto-currency is another stop in the economic evolution of money.\n",
      "In other words, the fact that we are actively developing these currencies, and are holding them as supplements to our cash balances, means that the currencies are valid products of human action. The only problem is finding out how to fix the flaws in Bitcoin, or build a currency without any destructive flaws.\n",

      "Bitcoin Basics\n",
      "We all know what Bitcoin is, where it comes from and what it’s used for. But many might not know is of its nature. Bitcoin’s value today has increased drastically and there have been cases where people invested in Bitcoins and became millionaires.\n",
      "Legal Status of Bitcoin\n",
      "There are many who have started using Bitcoin for their normal transactions. However, the risks associated with it still remain. These risks arise because it is not regulated by the government and central banks (Japan, however, has completely legalised it). And so if you’re robbed of your money, or if you have lost money from your account, there is nobody to complain to as there is no legal regulator yet. Considering these issues and the rising usage of the cryptocurrency in India, a recent article in Business Today has cited that the government formed a committee earlier this year to regulate the market. The report is still in process.\n",
      "Why Use Bitcoin?\n",
      "Bitcoins can be used to buy merchandise anonymously. You can use it for things as simple as retail shopping while your identity remains hidden.\n",
      "International payments are easy and cheap because Bitcoins are not tied to any country or subject to regulation.\n",
      "Bitcoins can simply be used to send money from one person to another, just like how you transfer your money from your e-wallet to that of someone else.\n",
      "Small businesses may use them as their primary mode of the transaction because there are no fees involved in the transaction.\n",
      "Some people just buy Bitcoins as an investment, hoping that they’ll go up in value.\n",
      "Future of Bitcoin\n",
      "Nobody can predict what the exact future of Bitcoin is going to be. Governments are worried about their lack of control on the market and currency and are looking at regulating it.\n",
      "Bitcoin still has a long way to go, but with the public slowly becoming comfortable with digital currencies and its use and with merchants also looking at its various advantages, the outlook seems bright. With every new cryptocurrency, there have been new developments. Several experts have seen great potential in the concept of Blockchain technology which is behind Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin is often compared to gold, and one of the main factors of similarity is how both were obtained. Just like gold, new bitcoins are generated through the mining process.\n",
      "In fact, the extraction of Bitcoin has a dual purpose: to allow the creation of new currencies and to facilitate the processing of transactions in the network.\n",

      "Bitcoin is a digital or virtual currency. It is a form of cryptocurrency. No central bank or authority controls it. You can use it to buy products and services electronically.\n",
      "How is it different from normal currencies?\n",
      "A financial institution issues and controls the normal currencies. For example – Federal Reserve System of the United States issues United States Dollar and Reserve Bank of India controls Indian Rupee. The organic nature of the bitcoin sets it apart from normal currencies. It is not controlled by any central authority or institution. It is fully decentralized.\n",
      "It is maintained by the bitcoin network. It is a network of connected computers and ASIC machines. These machines and computers take part in confirmation of the transactions. These computers are often referred as miners and the transaction confirmation process is called mining.\n",
      "Bitcoin will never have more than 21 million coins in circulation. This creates a market cap on it. Financial institutions can always create more units in case of normal currencies. This causes inflation.\n",
      "How to get it?\n",
      "Buy on an Exchange: Bitcoin exchanges allow people to buy or sell bitcoins using different currencies. Coinbase, LocalBitcoins, Cryptopay, Zebpay are some of the popular exchanges.\n",
      "Transfers: You can send and receive bitcoin electronically like normal currencies.\n",
      "Mining: Miners connected to bitcoin network confirm transactions by solving complex math problems. A new unit of the currency gets created after a successful confirmation of the transaction. Miners get the new unit as a reward for their job in the network.\n",
      "Where to store it?\n",
      "You can keep normal currencies with yourself or in banks. But for bitcoin, you don’t need a bank. You can be your own bank.\n",

      "Bitcoin is gaining popularity worldwide. It being accepted by many popular merchants like Expedia, Dell and Microsoft.\n",

      "There is no doubt that Bitcoin is not only one of the HOT keywords to search on Google recent year but also one of the HOT topics in daily conversation with our friends. One day, my friend recommends me to buy Bitcoin; honestly, I feel funny to invest in a digital currency that I have no idea where It comes from and how its value is. Therefore, I do not research about this topic until last year when the Bitcoin value reaches $17000. This topic becomes the HOT news that I want to spend time to research more about this “magical currency\". Let's take an overview of Bitcoin\n",
      "What is Bitcoin?\n",
      " Bitcoin - A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System' is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called \"crypto-currency\", which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than a central authority. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.\n",
      "Who is the creator of Bitcoin? Who is the real Satoshi Nakamoto?\n",
      " The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the computer programmer who created the virtual currency bitcoin, is one of the most controversial stories in technology. In 2008, Nakamoto launched bitcoin with a white paper; in 2011, he disappeared just as the project was hitting its stride, his frequent forum posts and e-mails tapering off to silence. (In his last known correspondence, he told a bitcoin developer that he had “moved on to other things.”) The mystery will take us from the Land of the Rising Sun all the way across the world to a small Californian town named Temple City and then back across the Pacific Ocean to an Australian doctor.\n",
      "However, when the world's media thought they had found their Satoshi Nakamoto in 2014 - he was a computer engineer living in Temple City in Los Angeles County, the Japanese-American man, named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto denied he is Satoshi Nakamoto. Another best known Nakamoto-suspect is Australian computer scientist and businessman Craig Wright.\n",
      "Nevertheless, The Economist states that \"such demonstrations can be stage-managed” and reported Wright refused to make the proof public and to provide other assurances. Until now, “There is currently no publicly available cryptographic proof that anyone, in particular, is Bitcoin's creator.”\n",
      "How to mine Bitcoin? How to get Bitcoins?\n",
      " Bitcoins act like cash, but they are mined like gold. So how does someone get into the current bitcoin rush?\n",
      " If properly done and willing to take the investment risk, you could wind up with a few bitcoins of your own—which currently have an average weekly price of $945 on the largest bitcoin exchange. When the algorithm was created under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto—which in Japanese is as common a name as Steve Smith—the individual(s) set a finite limit on the number of bitcoins that will ever exist: 21 million.\n",
      "Currently, more than 12 million are in circulation. That means that a little less than 9 million bitcoins are waiting to be discovered. That's the way the system was set up—easy to mine in the beginning, and harder as we approach that 21 millionth bitcoin. At the current rate of creation, the final bitcoin will be mined in the year 2140.\n",
      "There are three primary ways to obtain bitcoins: buying on an exchange, accepting them for goods and services, and mining new ones. \"Mining\" is lingo for the discovery of new bitcoins—just like finding gold. In reality, it's simply the verification of bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin mining can be done by a computer novice—requiring basic software and specialized hardware.\n",
      "Is Bitcoin legal?\n",
      " Bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in most jurisdictions. However, some jurisdictions (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies. Other jurisdictions (such as Thailand) may limit the licensing of certain entities such as Bitcoin exchanges.\n",
      "Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the United States Treasury Department, issued non-binding guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies.\n",
      "Do you think bitcoins are approaching being unethical monetary?\n",
      "It is worth pointing out that bitcoin is a digital currency that there is no regulation. Unlike U.S dollar or other official currency are issued by the central authority that the value of current is protected from government regulation, there is no central authority to control the transactions of bitcoin. Therefore. it allows freeing movement of the value of the online market. Moreover, the price of bitcoin is not stable that its value increased about $6000 early in 2017 to nearly $18000 end of 2017. The more the value bitcoin increases, the more the bubble happens in advance that leads to some financial crisis like 2008 financial crisis.\n",
      "What counts is that it becomes the new payment system recent years. It will adversely affect not only on the sustainable growth of economic market but also on the people who invest in this digital currency. Additionally, since no central bank protects the bitcoins, it is easy for the hacker to steal people's bitcoin. Additionally, Bitcoin does not seem to be an official payment on most of the business because it is new and no one guarantees for the value.\n",
      "In fact, bitcoins do not have any real value as silver or gold that its value replies on demand and supply economics. Therefore, some experts mention that bitcoins are linked to Ponzi Scheme that an investment is a fraud when it pays investors with money collected from new investors. As a result, when no new investors, bitcoins will be collapsed. There are some countries they ban to use this digital currency such as Russia. If one day Bitcoin becomes the illegal currency, you will lose your money\n",
      "Since there is no one control the Bitcoin, it is easy for people to use Bitcoin for illegal activities. It is worth pointing out that the less regulation Bitcoin get the easier people take an advantage to make private and irreversible payments. Depend on how the people use Bitcoin for an illegal purpose, it will make the bitcoins unethical.\n",
      "I highly recommend you to read this book: Digital Gold by Nathaniel Popper - New York Time Book Review Editor's Choice if you want to research more about this digital currency or plan to invest in Bitcoin. This book will give you the landmark digital money and financial technology that has spawned a global social movement.\n",

      "*BITCOIN* How it works?\n",
      "A lot of monkeys lived near a village\n",
      "One day a merchggant came to the village to buy these monkeys!\n",
      "He announced that he will buy the monkeys @ $100 each.\n",
      "The villagers thought that this man is mad\n",
      "They thought how can somebody buy stray monkeys at $100 each?\n",
      "Still, some people caught some monkeys and gave it to this merchant and he gave $100 for each monkey.\n",
      "This news spread like wildfire and people caught monkeys and sold it to the merchant\n",
      "After a few days, the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys @ 200 each\n",
      "The lazy villagers also ran around to catch the remaining monkeys!\n",
      "They sold the remaining monkeys @ 200 each.\n",
      "Then the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys @ 500 each!\n",
      "The villagers start to lose sleep! ... They caught six or seven monkeys, which was all that was left and got 500 each.\n",
      "The villagers were waiting anxiously for the next announcement\n",
      "Then the merchant announced that he is going home for a week. And when he returns, he will buy monkeys @ 1000 each!\n",
      "He asked his employee to take care of the monkeys he bought. He was alone taking care of all the monkeys in a cage.\n",
      "The merchant went home.\n",
      "The villagers were very sad as there were no more monkeys left for them to sell it at $1000 each\n",
      "Then the employee told them that he will sell some monkeys @ 700 each secretly.\n",
      "This news spread like fire. Since the merchant buys monkey @ 1000 each, there is a 300 profit for each monkey.\n",
      "The next day, villagers made a queue near the monkey cage.\n",
      "The employee sold all the monkeys at 700 each. The rich bought monkeys in big lots. The poor borrowed money from money lenders and also bought monkeys!\n",
      "The villagers took care of their monkeys & waited for the merchant to return.\n",
      "But nobody came! ... Then they ran to the employee...\n",
      "But he has already left too !\n",
      "The villagers then realised that they have bought the useless stray monkeys @ 700 each and unable to sell them!\n",
      "The Bitcoin will be the next monkey  business\n",
      "It will make a lot of people bankrupt and a few people filthy rich in this monkey business.\n",

      "It is the first Decentralized currency\n",
      "I know what you are thinking. And that is : “If I hear the words “Decentralized currency” one more time, I am gonna personally find Satoshi Nakamoto and decentralize him”.\n",
      "Right, so let’s see what Decentralized currency means later. For now, let’s see what is Currency.\n",
      "Currency is a tool which we use to exchange values. Earlier people were using Gold and other valuable metals to exchange with goods required by them. Gold was tangible. If a certain amount of Gold were to be in your hand, it basically meant you owned it.\n",
      "Due to Gold’s obvious disadvantages, we started using paper money. What we currently are acquainted with is something called Fiat Currency. Which means we are basically assuming that a particular piece of paper is worth some value.\n",
      "*I promise to pay the bearer(of this note) the sum of one hundred rupees*\n",
      "Nowadays most of the money is just in the form of numbers. So there is a possibility that the same money can be used for multiple transactions. This problem is called as “Double Spending”.\n",
      "To avoid this, banks keep a ledger to keep track of all the transactions essentially acting as a Centre. Hence our conventional money is called as Centralized Currency.\n",
      "Some computer scientists were not satisfied with a third party(bank) keeping track of transactions. This is when Satoshi Nakamoto comes in and proposes and entirely different solution where there is no 3rd party involved(decentralized currency). BITCOIN\n",
      "Decentralized currency is like Internet. There is no one entity owning it(yet).\n",
      "The deal with Bitcoin is that all the transactions are public and the ledger recording those transactions are public. This ledger is called as a BLOCKCHAIN. Everyone can have a copy of it and tally their transactions.\n",
      "There might be issues regarding security but think of hacking a bitcoin blockchain as hacking english dictionary. You can change the meaning of a word in one dictionary. But not in every other copy in the world.\n",
      "If you are still reading, I will add more content on it in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Bitcoin?\n",
      "Bitcoin is the first global, decentralized currency that allows you to send money from one person to another without involving a third party broker, such as a bank. You only need your computer to make transactions because Bitcoin is fundamentally software.\n",
      "As a decentralized currency, Bitcoin isn’t controlled by anyone. It’s open so that anyone can benefit from it.\n",
      "You might think that the lack of control could mean chaos, but that’s not true at all. That’s because Blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin is one of the most accurate and secure systems ever created.\n",
      "How Does Bitcoin Work?\n",
      "A blockchain is a ledger that keeps records of digital transactions. Instead of having a central administrator, like a bank or the government, blockchain organizes data in batches (What is a blockchain, and why is it growing in popularity?) called blocks. These data batches use cryptographic validation to link themselves together. In other words, each block identifies and references the previous block by a hash value (Hash function - Wikipedia), forming an unbroken chain.\n",
      "Blockchain solves two of the most challenging problems of digital transactions (There is a 'game changer' technology on Wall Street and people keep confusing it with bitcoin): controlling the information and avoiding duplication. When a purchase is carried out, the ledger records it and sends it out to the entire network. Computers all over the world then compete to confirm the operation by solving complex math equations. The first to figure out the answer and validate the block receives a reward in Bitcoins (this process is called mining.)\n",
      "The validated block is timestamped and added to a chain in chronological order. The entire chain is continually updated so that it’s always an accurate representation of who owns what at any given time.\n",
      "Is it Legal?\n",
      "The legality of Bitcoin depends on where you’re located. Bitcoin was legalized as a formal method of payment in Japan this year, and India might be next. In most countries, however, it somewhat operates in a gray zone, with no official ban or approval of Bitcoin.\n",
      "Who’s Behind it?\n",
      "The founder of Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous online alias for a forum poster. The founder remains unknown, and no one truly knows who the actual founder is.\n",
      "At the moment, Bitcoin is owned by the community as a whole, as it is an open source initiative, with no single owner behind it. It is a community movement.\n",

      "What Is Bitcoin:\n",
      "Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, or a digital currency, that uses rules of cryptography for regulation and generation of units of currency. Bitcoin falls under the scope of cryptocurrency and was the first and most valuable among them. It is commonly called a decentralised digital currency.\n",
      "A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies are classified as a subset of digital currencies and are also classified as a subset of alternative currencies and virtual currencies.\n",
      "How does Bitcoin works:\n",
      "Bitcoins are completely virtual coins designed to be ‘self-contained’ for their value, with no need for banks to move and store the money.\n",
      "Once you own bitcoins, they possess value and trade just as if they were nuggets of gold in your pocket. You can use your bitcoins to purchase goods and services online, or you can tuck them away and hope that their value increases over the years. Bitcoins are traded from one personal 'wallet' to another.\n",
      "A wallet is a small personal database that you store on your computer drive, on your smartphone, on your tablet, or somewhere in the cloud.\n",
      "Bitcoin shares some similarities with real-world currencies, particularly its growing acceptance as a form of payment with more and more merchants, retailers and individuals, both online and offline. You can buy Microsoft products with Bitcoin, buy airline tickets through Expedia, or buy gift cards to superstores like Walmart.\n",
      "Yet Bitcoin is also very different from traditional currencies. Unlike dollars or pounds, Bitcoin isn't backed by any government. It's a completely decentralized form of money. Bitcoin isn't linked to any sort of central banking system or issuing authority, and that's a big part of its appeal — instead of being swallowed into a system that's often sullied by human greed and manipulation, this currency exists in an online world driven by mathematics and clever encryption protocols.\n",
      "You can use Bitcoin for all sorts of real transactions. To do so, you first buy bitcoins however you like, either through your credit card, a bank account or even anonymously with cash. Then your bitcoins are transferred directly into your Bitcoin wallet, and you can send and receive payments directly to a buyer or seller without the need for a typical go-between, such as a bank or credit card company.\n",
      "Here Iam sharing one video to know more information about how bitcoin is working\n",
      "Who is Behind Bitcoin:\n",
      "Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the unknown person or people who designed bitcoin and created its original reference implementation. As part of the implementation, they also devised the first block chain database. In the process they were the first to solve the double-spending problem for digital currency. They were active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010.\n",
      "Is Bitcoin Legal:\n",
      "The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. Whilst the majority of countries do not make the usage of bitcoin itself illegal, its status as money (or a commodity) varies, with differing regulatory implications. While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently.\n",
      "But for the most part it remains relatively safe to use as long as it is not tied to illicit purchases or activities. Many countries have issued statements indicating that bitcoin and other digital currencies are not regulated and do not exist as officially sanctioned currencies: a status that could put users at risk but would not have them violating any laws. Bitcoin is outright illegal in some countries, such as Iceland.\n",
      "Depending on where and how you utilize bitcoin, it is important to remain up-to-date on the latest regulations concerning the digital currency. As laws change across borders, governing bodies and, increasingly, as the platform gains popularity, questions about bitcoin’s legality will continue to be raised.\n",

      "Original question: ‘What is a Bitcoin pool’\n",
      "First things first, what is Bitcoin mining? Bitcoin mining is the process in which Bitcoin transactions (or any other cryptocurrency transactions) are verified and added to the Blockchain – a public ledger. Through this process, new bitcoins are released. People called “miners” use special software to solve complex math problems and are rewarded with Bitcoin. This results in both new Bitcoin and motivation for people to mine it.\n",
      "There are two main ways of mining. One is doing it solo and the other is doing it in a mining pool. A pool is a place where different miners join forces, share their processing power and, of course, share the reward equally. This happens after they solve a block.\n",
      "Mining solo could mean, especially for beginners or slow miners, not getting an award in years. When the pool of joint miners solves a block, the 12.5 bitcoins are generated and shared by the pool participants.\n",
      "To sum up, mining solo means that if you solve a block you earn 12.5 bitcoins by yourself, not having to share it with anyone. As a matter of fact, solo miners don’t have to pay any type of fee. On the other hand, solo mining is a lot more difficult process and could mean never earning anything. This is why lots of miners start mining in pools.\n",
      "Beginners usually don’t know how to start mining, and which cryptocurrency to choose. There is a pool called 'Multipool' which shows you the most profitable cryptocurrency for the type of hardware you have. When you create an account on the pool’s website, you will create a 'worker'. If you have several pieces of mining hardware, you can create several workers.\n",
      "Some websites offer lists of some of the best mining pools. For example, AntPool is of the most efficient mining pool. AntPool participants have solved around 18% of the total solved blocks. AntPool is followed by BTC.com. BTC.com participants solved around 16.5% of the total solved blocks. Third in line is BTC.TOP. It has mined about 13% of all bitcoins mined in the past six months.\n",
      "Difficulty levels of mining could vary, so can the efficiency of any particular mining pool. This means never taking one-time information for granted, especially when big financial decisions are the matter.\n",

      "A mining pool or Bitcoin mining pool is a collection of miners working together to reduce the volatility of their returns.\n",
      "It is the same thing as diversification in portfolio management – or where holding ten stocks is better than holding 1.\n",
      "When miners try and find a hash to the correct block they are taking part in a lottery.\n",
      "If there are a thousand tickets and you hold one of those tickets the probability of you winning the lottery is one in a thousand, but if you hold 100 of the tickets then your chances are one in ten – so you can expect to win the lottery every 10 drawings. With your one ticket, you would expect to win every 1000 lottery drawings.\n",
      "However, if you can’t afford 100 tickets you can join together with another 99 individuals and form a syndicate and split the reward every time you win. This will mean your cash inflow would be less but more often and so the volatility of returns is lower.\n",
      "The same thing is true for Bitcoin and crypto currency mining. If you have a 1TH machine and the Bitcoin Network total hashpower is 1 PetaHash then you have a 1 in 1000 chance of solving the block every ten minutes. You might not even solve it for longer periods, but by joining together with other miners in a pool you can form a syndicate and work in concert to split the returns in relation to what percentage of hashpower you contribute to the pool. So if you have 10 TH of a 100 TH mining pool and you win the block reward of 25 Bitcoins – you would receive 10% or 2.5 BTC.\n",
      "With mining, it is important to understand the different types of blocks that come with it because of the effect it can have on your expected income. This article provides a comprehensive insight into orphan, uncle & genesis blocks.\n",
      "Mining pools are a good way of smoothing your returns but they do cost – usually 1-2% of your winnings. Instead of hooking up your Bitcoin miner that you have bought – you can outsource it further by buying a mining contract that gives you rights to a certain amount of hash power for a certain period of time. This is called cloud mining.\n",
      "See our guides on how to join a mining pool and comparison of Bitcoin mining contracts that you can buy off the shelf at a moments notice!\n",

      "The difficulty of mining Bitcoin is very high today. It means, that your chances of mining a block are very low. Let’s say that you bought mining gear that on average allow you to mine 1 block in 10 years. It means that the expected return on your mining gear can be about $125,000 worth in 10 years (assuming usd/btc rate of $10k).\n",
      "Nevertheless, due to the statistic nature of mining, it might happen before, or it might happen after. 10 years in only the average time. Are you willing to wait 10–15 years just to be rewarded? What if Bitcoin doesn’t exist by then? Or if the mining mechanism changes?\n",
      "In order to reduce this uncertainty, many people who own mining equipment join hands and mine together. With an increased mining power the average time to get a block decreases. For example, if you collaborate with 100 people with the same mining power as above, you will all win a block every month on average. Therefore, it will allow you to get paid $125,000 divided by 100 every month or so. It has much less risk.\n",
      "These are exactly mining pools. Mining pools allow people to join their mining power and collaborate in order to decrease the expected time to find a block and thus reduce the risk.\n",
      "The pool basically tells you what block to harvest (a block that rewards the pool owner). How does the pool know how much mining power you put into the pool mining? You send the pool owner proofs of work. They are the same as the proofs that you send the blockchain, only with a much lower difficulty. Every time you mine the pool block and you find a hash that is below the difficulty of the pool, you send it to the pool and get rewarded with a share that represents your relative effort.\n",
      "If you are the one miner that actually finds the block, you still have the incentive to send the block to the pool because:\n",
      "You mined the pool’s block that gives the pool owner the mining reward. You can’t benefit from this block.\n",
      "That’s how you get paid. If you won’t send it to the pool, it won’t have the Bitcoin to share back with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A Bitcoin pool or preferably say Bitcoin mining pool is a community of different miners renting renting their hash power to a central mining company for the effective mining of the virtual currency. The more the hash power a miner rents out, the more profits(rewards) he/she makes. There are many mining companies out there, some are legit and some are not. Some of the best are\n",

      "We’re sitting on a park bench. It’s a great day.\n",
      "I have one apple with me. I give it to you.\n",
      "You now have one apple and I have zero.\n",
      "That was simple, right?\n",
      "Let’s look closely at what happened:\n",
      "My apple was physically put into your hand.\n",
      "You know it happened. I was there. You were there. You touched it.\n",
      "We didn’t need a third person there to help us make the transfer. We didn’t need to pull in Uncle Tommy (who’s a famous judge) to sit with us on the bench and confirm that the apple went from me to you.\n",
      "The apple’s yours! I can’t give you another apple because I don’t have any left. I can’t control it anymore. The apple left my possession completely. You have full control over that apple now. You can give it to your friend if you want, and then that friend can give it to his friend. And so on.\n",
      "So that’s what an in-person exchange looks like. I guess it’s really the same, whether I’m giving you a banana, a book, or say a quarter, or a dollar bill….\n",
      "But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n",
      "Back to apples!\n",
      "Now say, I have one digital apple. Here, I’ll give you my digital apple.\n",
      "Ah! Now it gets interesting.\n",
      "How do you know that that digital apple that used to be mine, is now yours, and only yours? Think about it for a second.\n",
      "It’s more complicated, right? How do you know that I didn’t send that apple to Uncle Tommy as an email attachment first? Or your friend Joe? Or my friend Lisa too?\n",
      "Maybe I made a couple of copies of that digital apple on my computer. Maybe I put it up on the internet and one million people downloaded it.\n",
      "As you see, this digital exchange is a bit of a problem. Sending digital apples doesn’t look like sending physical apples.\n",
      "Some brainy computer scientists actually have a name for this problem: it’s called the double-spending problem. But don’t worry about it. All you need to know is that, it’s confused them for quite some time and they’ve never solved it.\n",
      "Until now.\n",
      "But let’s try to think of a solution on our own.\n",
      "Ledgers\n",
      "Maybe these digital apples need to be tracked in a ledger. It’s basically a book where you track all transactions — an accounting book.\n",
      "This ledger, since it’s digital, needs to live in its own world and have someone in charge of it.\n",
      "Say, just like World of Warcraft. Blizzard, the guys who created the online game, have a “digital ledger” of all the rare flaming fire swords that exist in their system. So, cool, someone like them could keep track of our digital apples. Awesome — we solved it!\n",
      "Problems\n",
      "There’s a bit of a problem though:\n",
      "1) What if some guy over at Blizzard created more? He could just add a couple of digital apples to his balance whenever he wants!\n",
      "2) It’s not exactly like when we were on the bench that one day. It was just you and me then. Going through Blizzard is like pulling in Uncle Tommy(a third-party) out of court(did I mention he’s a famous judge?) for all our park bench transactions. How can I just hand over my digital apple to you, like, you know— the usual way?\n",
      "Is there any way to closely replicate our park bench, just you-and-me, transaction digitally? Seems kinda tough…\n",
      "The Solution\n",
      "What if we gave this ledger — to everybody? Instead of the ledger living on a Blizzard computer, it’ll live in everybody’s computers. All the transactions that have ever happened, from all time, in digital apples will be recorded in it.\n",
      "You can’t cheat it. I can’t send you digital apples I don’t have, because then it wouldn’t sync up with everybody in the system. It’d be a tough system to beat. Especially if it got really big.\n",
      "Plus it’s not controlled by one person, so I know there’s no one that can just decide to give himself more digital apples. The rules of the system were already defined at the beginning. And the code and rules are open-source—you know, kinda like the software used in your mom’s Android phone. Or kinda like Wikipedia. It’s there for the smart people to contribute to, maintain, secure, improve on, and check on.\n",
      "You could participate in this network too and update the ledger and make sure it all checks out. For the trouble, you could get like 25 digital apples as a reward. In fact, that’s the only way to create more digital apples in the system.\n",
      "I simplified quite a bit\n",
      "…but that system I explained exists. It’s called the Bitcoin protocol. And those digital apples are the “bitcoins” within the system. Fancy!\n",
      "So, did you see what happened? What does the public ledger enable?\n",
      "1) Its open source remember? The total number of apples was defined in the public ledger at the beginning. I know the exact amount that exists. Within the system, I know they are limited (scarce).\n",
      "2) When I make an exchange I now know that digital apple certifiably left my possession and is now completely yours. I used to not be able to say that about digital things. It will be updated and verified by the public ledger.\n",
      "3) Because it’s a public ledger, I didn’t need Uncle Tommy (third-party) to make sure I didn’t cheat, or make extra copies for myself, or send apples twice, or thrice…\n",
      "Within the system, the exchange of a digital apple is now just like the exchange of a physical one. It’s now as good as seeing a physical apple leave my hand and drop into your pocket. And just like on the park bench, the exchange involved two people only. You and me — we didn’t need Uncle Tommy there to make it valid.\n",
      "In other words, it behaves like a physical object.\n",
      "But you know what’s cool? It’s still digital. We can now deal with 1,000 apples, or 1 million apples, or even .0000001 apples. I can send it with a click of a button, and I can still drop it in your digital pocket if I was in Nicaragua and you were all the way in New York.\n",
      "I can even make other digital things ride on top of these digital apples! It’s digital after-all. Maybe I can attach some text on it — a digital note. Or maybe I can attach more important things; like say a contract, or a stock certificate, or an ID card…\n",
      "So this is great! How should we treat or value these “digital apples”? They’re quite useful aren’t they?\n",
      "Well, a lot of people are arguing over it now. There’s debate between this and that economic school. Between politicians. Between programmers. Don’t listen to all of them though. Some people are smart. Some are misinformed. Some say the system is worth a lot, some say it’s actually worth zero. Some guy actually put a hard number: $1,300 per apple. Some say its digital gold, some a currency. Other say they’re just like tulips. Some people say it’ll change the world, some say it’s just a fad.\n",
      "I have my own opinion about it.\n",
      "That’s a story for another time though. But kid, you now know more about Bitcoin than most.\n",

      "Are goats any better than monkeys? It is for you to decide\n",
      "The decentralised digital currency Bitcoin hit $17,000 recently. In one day, it gained as much as what it's entire value was at the beginning of 2017. It's very exciting stuff for some people. There's a widespread view that implicitly implies that since bitcoin is a 'digital' construct, those buying and selling them are immune to psychological flaws that humans are prone to. This idea is too ridiculous to even refute.\n",
      "Do note that I'm not criticising bitcoin or its underlying blockchain technology. I think these are revolutionary inventions and will eventually have a deeply transformational impact. I'm only talking about how people are going crazy while trading bitcoin right now.\n",
      "If you find the idea of trading bitcoins attractive, do read this column that I read decade ago, in November 2007, when the Indian stock markets were in the grip of a similar mania.\n",
      "Monkeys, Goats and Markets\n",
      "So, there was this village where one day a man appeared and said that he wanted to buy monkeys. He said that he would pay a hundred rupees for one monkey. The villagers caught all the monkeys in the neighbourhood and sold them to him for a hundred rupees each. Soon another man appeared and said that he would pay two hundred rupees for each monkey. But there weren't any more monkeys around. They were all owned by the first man. So the villagers went back to him and said that they wanted to take the monkeys back and return his money. But the monkey owner was unwilling to sell. The villagers raised the price offered to Rs 150 per monkey, then Rs 175 and finally to Rs 199 but the man still didn't want to sell, even though he clearly had no use for the monkeys. Eventually, just to see whether he would sell, they offered him Rs 200 but he still refused.\n",
      "The villagers were puzzled by this. Finally, one of them assumed that there must be someone else who was going to come to the village and offer even more money for the monkeys. Convinced that this was the real explanation, they went and offered the man Rs 300 for each monkey and sure enough the man accepted. Joyous at having landed such a good deal, they quickly paid him off before he changed his mind and took possession of the monkeys. The man went away with his money and presumably lived happily ever after. The villagers waited for the next buyer. But they kept waiting and waiting. But no one ever appeared who wanted to buy the monkeys.\n",
      "If you think you've guessed the moral of the story, you are wrong because the story isn't over yet. This story isn't quite the same as the monkey story you may have come across in one of those forwarded chain- emails. My version is slightly different. There was another village nearby where a man appeared one day and offered a thousand rupees for a goat. Now, goats are valuable, but it does not cost as much as a thousand rupees a piece, so the villagers happily sold all the goats to this man. A similar thing happened here too. A second man appeared and offered two thousand rupees for each goat. The first man refused to sell at the buying price and eventually the villagers ended up buying back the goats for Rs 3,000 each. Here too, both the men disappeared and no one ever came and offered so much money for a goat again. But there was a difference. Goats aren't monkeys. They can be milked every day and the milk is good for health. In fact I've heard that Gandhiji preferred having goat milk. Even the goat droppings can be used as fuel, though I'm not sure of this. When the goats eventually grow too old to be milked, it can be killed for meat. So, buying goats wasn't a complete disaster for the villagers.\n",
      "But the monkey-owners were not so lucky. Since, these weren't demat monkeys, they had to be kept in one's house. The monkeys ate too much, shouted and shrieked all day and sometimes bit people. Eventually, when it became clear that the monkeys were worthless, their owners abandoned them in the forest nearby and tried to forget about their losses. And that's the moral of the story. In the stock markets today, there are good companies that are overpriced and there are worthless companies that are overpriced. If you are going to be a fool and pay absurd prices because you think that a greater fool will appear in the future, make sure you buy a goat and not a monkey.\n",
      "This was written in November 2007, but the situation is not very different now in circa December 2017. So if you want to make soaring profits from your investments, do not buy this bitcoin monkey. Also stay away from the monkey stocks in the Indian equity markets. The markets are at a high and there are plenty of monkeys disguised as goats. So, please be cautious!\n",

      "Bitcoin is a crypto-currency or software that forms a decentralized, peer-to-peer, world-wide payment system, without the control of any centralised authority.The blockchain software resides on thousands of computers, all over the world and is maintained by a mix of ordinary people and more sophisticated computer experts, collectively known as ‘miners’. Bitcoins are transferred via a peer-to-peer network between individuals, with no middleman bank to take a slice.\n",
      "The unit of account in this system is ‘Bitcoin’. A ‘Satoshi’ (named after its creator) is the smallest amount within bitcoin, representing 0.00000001 bitcoin, i.e. divisible down to 8 decimal points.\n",
      "The bitcoin network runs on a software system called ‘blockchain’. The blockchain software can be used to store and send anything of value, so there are companies using it to store documents like property deeds, etc. Blockchain as a technology is becoming popular among banks and other big financial institutions, who want to use it to settle payments on their back-end systems.\n",
      "Bitcoin can be converted into ordinary currency based on its value on that date, or even used to make purchases from sellers that accept bitcoin.\n",
      "The bitcoin blockchain by itself is very secure, but the bitcoins can be stolen from an account by stealing log-on and password info, i.e. ‘private key’ of the account holder and the bitcoin can be sent to another account controlled by the thief. Once bitcoin is transferred, it can’t be recovered.\n",
      "At present, most investors are not really using it like a currency to make payments, but instead, are using it as a speculative investment, with the hope to turn it into profit in the future. As on date, ‘bitcoin’ has not been accepted as a legal tender in India. Japan and Australia have officially accepted bitcoin as a legal currency.\n",
      "Bitcoin is being considered as a genuine innovation that will be around for a long time and help transform money.\n",
      "Positive Implications Of Rise Of This Crypto-Currency:\n",
      "• Governments across the world have already stepped in, to regulate trading in bitcoin, so that it can become a more established part of the financial system. Hence, it will actually legitimize the currency and broaden its adoption for investors.\n",
      "• Some financial experts see the recent surge in bitcoin market as a bubble that may burst. But because the bitcoin market cap is very small, even if it crashed, it would not have a significant impact on the broader financial markets.\n",
      "• In the recent weeks it has been seen that the global stock market rally has slowed down, but bitcoin has continued to surge higher, which is luring more and more investors to invest in this market.\n",
      "• Slowly bitcoin as a currency is catching on among some retailers, mostly e-commerce: US companies like, Overstock accepts bitcoin, as does Microsoft’s Xbox store, and PayPal and Square allow merchants to accept bitcoin.\n",
      "• The retailers might even encourage customers to pay in bitcoin in future if it costs them less in transaction fees than credit cards do.\n",
      "Negative Implications\n",
      "• Sincebitcoin transfers cannot be traced, bitcoin is often used to purchase drugs or stolen goods or finance other types of criminal activity.\n",
      "• It can become a major source for terror funding across the globe.\n",
      "• It is believed that 40% of the bitcoin are owned by just 1000 people and hence, powerful people or ‘whales’ could collude to influence the price of bitcoin.\n",
      "• Moreover, since there are relatively few buyers and sellers of bitcoin, this market is likely to remain volatile and the ‘whales’ could easily push the price around.\n",
      "• There is a risk that the demand of bitcoin may go down sending its price plummeting. It can happen because of any unforeseen circumstances like, technical problem, regulatory interference, bad publicity arising from the massive amount of electrical power needed to mine for bitcoin, etc.\n",
      "• Bitcoin offers both anonymity and the security of an electronic transaction. Hence, bitcoin can become a sub-economy where people could hide their income and evade government taxes.\n",
      "• Bitcoin is not as liquid as other investments, firstly because settlement can take more than a week, and secondly, amid panic selling, some bitcoin holders might be unable to sell for a fairly long time, resulting in steep losses.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Bitcoin as a crypto-currency is gaining huge popularity. In fact, on 03 March 2017, the price of a bitcoin had surpassed the market value of an ounce of gold for the first time as its price surged to an all-time high of $1,268.\n",
      "However, big banks, brokers and financial institutions have warned that bitcoin currency should not be ushered in hurriedly without adequate transparency, regulatory mechanism and risk assessment.\n",
      "Bitcoin users predict 94% of all bitcoins will have been released by 2024. As the total number creeps toward the 21 million mark, many suspect the profits miners once made creating new blocks will become so low they'll become negligible. But with more bitcoins in circulation, people also expect transaction fees to rise, possibly making up the difference.\n",

      "What is Bitcoin?\n",
      "Bitcoin is a digital currency which is traded on applications based virtual exchanges throughout the world. Bitcoin is often quoted in dollar terms but is widely traded in local currencies of the respective nation.\n",
      "Who invented Bitcoin?\n",
      "This remains a mysterious question till now. A person using the name Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin in 2009. According to Newsweek, he is an American-Japanese living in California with a full name Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
      "Where can you buy/sell Bitcoin in India?\n",
      "Bitcoin is traded on virtual exchange based applications, it can be bought and sold on these only. In India, there are several Bitcoin applications which facilitate Bitcoin trading, for example, Zebpay, Unocoin and Coinsecure.\n",
      "How can you buy/sell a Bitcoin?\n",
      "Bitcoin can be bought and sold very easily after creating an account with the trading partner filling in your necessary details.\n",
      "What is all needed to trade in Bitcoin?\n",
      "In India, the mandatory things needed to start Bitcoin trading are an active email account, a bank account, a mobile number, an aadhaar card and a pan card.\n",
      "How is Bitcoin price calculated?\n",
      "As of now Bitcoin is not regulated or governed by anybody anywhere. Bitcoin prices are calculated based on the demand and supply on respective exchanges.\n",
      "Why is there so much difference in Bitcoin prices across exchanges?\n",
      "Bitcoin neither have an intrinsic value nor it is derived from an underlying asset. With a huge difference in the number of people participating on different exchanges, the price of Bitcoin varies accordingly.\n",
      "Can you trade Bitcoin between different exchanges?\n",
      "Several traders enjoy a huge price arbitrage across Bitcoin exchanges. But there is no common or central depository for Bitcoin unlike that in the stock market. Therefore Bitcoin is usually bought and sold on the same exchange only.\n",
      "Can you buy things with bitcoins?\n",
      "In India, credit and debit cards are rarely accepted in rural and even in few semi-urban areas, imagine yourself how much Bitcoin can be accepted. Though there have been few places which have started accepting Bitcoins but with a very high volatility and price fluctuations people refrain from transacting in Bitcoin.\n",
      "Do you know the total value of Bitcoins in the world?\n",
      "According to the latest data, the total value of all the Bitcoins in circulation has reached $283 billion. \"That makes its total value - sometimes dubbed its 'market cap' - greater than that of Visa, and bigger than the market cap of BlackRock and Citigroup combined,\" Reuters said in a report.\n",
      "How many Bitcoins are there?\n",
      "Around 21 million Bitcoins are available right now, according to a Reuters report. Interestingly, about 12.5 new Bitcoins are released into the system every 10 minutes through a process called 'mining'.\n",
      "How many Bitcoins are there without owners?\n",
      "Less than 16 bitcoins that have been already mined in circulation and accessible had been lost till now. This happens because of forgotten passwords of accounts, accidental losses, hoarding, owners forgetting about coins or even dying. It is impossible to know for sure how many bitcoins have been permanently lost, because those bitcoins are still in the system, in dormant addresses.\n",
      "What is cryptocurrency?\n",
      "Cryptocurrency is nothing but a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. Bitcoin is one such example of cryptocurrency.\n",
      "How many cryptocurrencies are there?\n",
      "There are more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies which are present in world traded on different exchanges. Popular being, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and recently spiked Litecoin.\n",
      "How is Bitcoin created?\n",
      "Bitcoins are created through a process called mining. There are many Bitcoin miners in the world, reportedly most of them located in Japan, China, US and Singapore.\n",
      "What is Bitcoin mining?\n",
      "Bitcoin mining is a process of creating virtual currencies like Bitcoin. Mining is an iterative process which incorporates machines with supercomputing power as in creating one Bitcoin, it takes about running an algorithm for about a million times.\n",
      "Are Bitcoins available in physical form?\n",
      "Yes, Bitcoins are also available in physical form. In the United States, there are several places which have Bitcoin ATMs also.\n",
      "What is Bitcoin ATM? How many are there in the world?\n",
      "Bitcoin ATM is just like another ATM machine, a difference is just that it gives out Bitcoins after you insert money into it. Reportedly there are about 1,400 Bitcoin ATMs in over 50 countries, as of August 2017.\n",
      "What is blockchain?\n",
      "Blockchain a technology in which transactions made in digital currencies are recorded chronologically and publicly. Blockchain as a technology supports Bitcoin trading, but it not synonymous with Bitcoin. Blockchain can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as tracking ownership or the provenance of documents, digital assets, physical assets or even voting rights.\n",
      "Smaller size of Bitcoin\n",
      "If you want to invest in Bitcoin then there is no obligation that you should buy a whole one unit of it. Bitcoin has a smaller unit called Satoshi, which is named after the anonymous inventor of cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto. One Satoshi is one-hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. According to a price of $16,000, one Satoshi equals $0.00016.\n",
      "What is Bitcoin Futures?\n",
      "Amid the rapidly rising popularity of Bitcoin, very recently, leading exchanges such as CME Group, CBOE and NASDAQ have announced that they will be offering future contracts over Bitcoin. Now, this is like anticipating the future of something, if you can't anticipate its underlying asset.\n",
      "Where is Bitcoin legalised?\n",
      "Bitcoin is a legal currency in over 60 major nations including the United States, China, Japan, United Kingdom, Mexico, Canada, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Germany, Switzerland. Interestingly, Bitcoin has not been legalised in India but many Indians are after it, in order of quick millionaire dream. Apart from India, Bitcoin is also stated as illegal tender in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.\n",
      "Can you mine Bitcoin at your home?\n",
      "Yes, you can mine Bitcoins at your homes but you will need supercomputers and very powerful servers which can handle the algorithms through which Bitcoin is mined and moreover, a habitual environment for those machines.These mining computers require a vast amount of energy to operate. As the prices of Bitcoin increase, more and more miners enter the market, driving up the energy consumption further. Earlier last week Reuters said in a report citing a tech news site Motherboard \"the energy cost of a single Bitcoin transaction at 215 kilowatt-hours, assuming that there are around 300,000 Bitcoin transactions per day. That's almost enough energy as the average American household consumes in a whole week.\"\n",
      "Can you steal Bitcoins?\n",
      "Bitcoin thefts have been reported many times as according to some experts bitcoin stealing requires moderate knowledge of hacking. Reportedly, over 9.8 lakh bitcoins have already been stolen from exchanges, either by hackers or insiders. At current prices of bitcoin, it is worth more than $15 billion.\n",
      "Are you biggest Bitcoin owner?\n",
      "There are 5,638,155 Bitcoins in the 1,000 biggest wallets, Reuters said in a report. This is more than a third of all Bitcoins in circulation which makes the 1,000 biggest wallet-holders worth a collective about $87 billion. This value keeps on changing with the movement in the price of Bitcoin.\n",
      "Where is largest Bitcoin trading happens?\n",
      "Reportedly, China was touted as the largest Bitcoin trading nation until early 2017, accounting about 90% of trading volume. \"But it has become clear that some exchanges inflated their volumes through so-called wash trades, repeatedly trading nominal amounts of Bitcoin back and forth between accounts,\" Reuters mentioned in a report. Chinese trading volumes have plummeted heavily after Chinese authorities have imposed transaction fees and now represent less than 20%, Reuters reported citing a website Bitcoinity. Now, the largest Bitcoin trading happens in Japan as there are huge retail investors which have taken riskiest bets in the past. According to a Reuters report, Japan has emerged as a major force in Bitcoin's spectacular rally, now accounting for an estimated 30-50% of trading in Bitcoin.\n",
      "Is Bitcoin trading safe?\n",
      "No, not at all safe. There have been clear warnings by many persons from around the world which has repeatedly stated that Bitcoin is a bubble with no intrinsic value.\n",
      "Is Bitcoin tax-free?\n",
      "Yes, in some countries. But with the rising reach of Bitcoins, it is now being used as a method to evade taxes. Even in India, tax regulators are reportedly conducting investigations into tax evasion using Bitcoin, and are mulling bringing the transactions under the tax net.\n",
      "Who has all warned about Bitcoin?\n",
      "World's biggest investment wizard, the maestro of Wall Street Warren Buffett said that \"You can't value Bitcoin because it's not a value-producing asset.\"\n",
      "Words from Chief of world?s largest investment bank\n",
      "Jamie Dimon, Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase. \"Bitcoin is a fraud and will blow up,\" Jamie Dimon said at an event in New York in September 2017, adding, \"The currency isn't going to work.\"\n",
      "Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said India does not recognise cryptocurrencies as legal tender. \"Recommendations are being worked at. The government's position is clear, we don't recognise this as legal currency as of now,\" Arun Jaitley said. Earlier in August, Arun Jaitley informed Parliament that, there are no regulations governing virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, in India and the RBI has not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies.\n",
      "Risks associated with Bitcoin\n",
      "With aforementioned risks of losing money, there is another major risk associated with it. There is no governing body, no regulator, no centralised check, no government intervention under any of its ministries be it department of finance or Electronics & Information Technology. As Bitcoin exchanges are very vulnerable to hacking and heists, even your personal data is at a risk of leak! One may recall bit threats of a dreaded ransomware earlier this year.\n",
      "High fees\n",
      "The average fee paid to process Bitcoin transactions has soared over the past year, outpacing even the staggering price increase of the cryptocurrency itself. Each Bitcoin transaction now costs around $7.3 to process, up from around 30 cents at the start of the year, according to trade website BitInfoCharts.\n",

      "Bitcoin is actually a type of digital currency, no one can control the network, it's highly decentralized. Bitcoin was the brainchild of Satoshi Nakamoto and came into operation in 2009. It Utilizes the P2P technology to function and has the flexibility and distinctive feature to engulf anyone who is interested. Bitcoin's worldwide acceptance is a feature that adds to its popularity.\n",
      "Bitcoins are 100% unique, they are not accountable to anyone. Bitcoins are sovereign with their own rules and regulations, and are not printed by any bank but mined. The production is done digitally by people involved in a colossal community or network. Enormous computing power is employed by miners, and there is a great deal of competition involved in Bitcoin mining.\n",
      "The job of the miners is to validate transactions, and everything is listed in a general ledger. This ledger is a collection of blocks named blockchain. This Blockchain holds the key to every detail of all the transactions recorded across various Bitcoin addresses.\n",
      "Today, Bitcoin has been integrated into our personal and business lives. This is made possible by the emergence of exchangers. Users and traders have a lot of choices when they want to buy this digital currency. The job of a Bitcoin Exchanger is to enable consumers to buy or sell Bitcoins by making use of regular currencies. There are many exchangers available today. With exchanges, consumers can buy or sell Bitcoins with cash, wire transfers or debit/credit card payment.\n",
      "The exchanges offer a secured trading and real-time platform. With so many users and traders keen on Bitcoins, this currency and all the craze surrounding it seems to grow by the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the brief explanation on Bitcoin,\n",
      "What is Bitcoin?\n",
      "Everyone must have already heard this term more than 1000 times in the last week. But still was unable to understand, what bitcoin really is?\n",
      "In simple words, Bitcoin is an encrypted file that can be stored and transferred easily. It's a cryptocurrency, the first and still the biggest of its type.\n",
      "Now, the question is why would you pay such a huge amount for a simple piece of code and how it became a currency? Think of a 500 rupee note that you have. Basically, it's a paper, but it gets its essence as a currency because of two reasons: It is validated by the government - no one can deny to accept it and it carries a fixed value. It is accepted as a medium of exchange in common trade. Same is with Bitcoins, although it is not backed by any government, it is accepted by common mass as a medium of exchange. People have accepted it as a medium of trade. It's the currency of masses.\n",
      "Fun Fact: It is believed that the value of the first bitcoin transactions was negotiated by individuals on the Bitcoin-talk forums with one notable transaction of 10,000 BTC used to indirectly purchase two pizzas.\n",
      "At its heart, it's a new form of digital asset, which is created through an unmatched combination of encryption (the same technology that WhatsApp uses to secure your messages) and peer-to-peer networking (the same technology that we use to download torrents from the internet).\n",
      "How it serves value to its users? Let's take an example: You need to send money from India to the USA. The most common way is to do it through bank wire transfer service. But for such transfer you end up paying a lot of fees: Currency conversion fees; Service fee to the bank for keeping a record of your money & ensuring safety; Another alternative is to use services like PayPal or Payoneer to send money to overseas. But If you're using a payment gateway such as Stripe, PayPal, or any other, you will pay transaction fees. Some of them also deduct conversion charges. In simple terms, you're paying money, almost 10-15% of your transaction amount, to the bank for securing & transferring the money on your behalf as an agent. In reality, everything is monitored through a large digitalized ledger and money is just transferred from one account to another. Even though everything is done digitally, why are you losing so much money? Well, this is how the whole banking revenue model works.\n",
      "Now, Bitcoin comes as a Savior.\n",
      "Unlike the regular currency of any country, Bitcoin is not regulated. It's official currency of the internet and anyone with an internet connection can get it. Also, It is freely transferable to anywhere in the world with a few clicks and has a very little processing charge.\n",
      "The Big Question: How do we record everything when transactions happen at such large scale and still keep a track who owns how much amount of money? Blockchain. It is the underlying technology on which Bitcoin relies. For a basic understanding, you can consider as a public digitalized ledger which records each and every transaction which happens on the network and is accessible to anyone who's on the internet. This accessibility and its large scale is something that makes it authentic because it is nearly impossible to alter or make any change in it at such a large scale at once. Any confirmed transactions (including newly added bitcoins) are recorded in blockchains. Think of this as a physical ledger. The only difference is it's maintained by public & anyone can use it to match a transaction. When any user initiates a new transaction (send or receive bitcoins), the transaction is verified using blockchains. I know it may be hard to understand what Bitcoin is in one go, but I will be trying to help you understand everything there is to know about Bitcoin technology in the coming weeks.\n",
      "Is Bitcoin the only cryptocurrency?\n",
      "Not at all, although it's still the most valuable digital currency out there. There are some other names also such as Ethereum, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and other 1370 currencies.\n",
      "What's the History of Bitcoin?\n",
      "In the month of October 2008, a white paper was published on a cryptography blog titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was published under a pseudo name Satoshi Nakamoto. In January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence after Nakamoto mined the first ever bitcoin. He is still a mystery. While he was active in the online bitcoin community for the first few years of the currency's life. However, no post appeared after his last post on 12 December 2010. Since then, there has been no action on the bitcoin holdings linked to his account, which are currently estimated to be worth $7bn. It may happen that we never know who invented bitcoin.\n",

      "He has since disappeared and left behind a Bitcoin fortune.\n",
      "Because Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to exist, all digital currencies created since then are called Altcoins, or alternative coins. Litecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin, Ethereum and hundreds of other coins are all Altcoins because they are not Bitcoin.\n",

It’s also believed that Satoshi Nakamoto is not a person but 4 companies namely Samsung, Toshiba, Nakamichi and Motorola.Transaction done buy bitcoin includes no interference of any person or any organization. The payee and the receiver remain completely anonymous here.Nowadays more and more peoples have started taking bitcoin and you can simply buy anything from a SSL Certificate to pouch of soup.\n",
      "Why Bitcoins?\n",
      "Bitcoins can be used to buy merchandise anonymously. It is also used by hackers and in the dark web to keep his or her personal information hidden. In addition, international payments are easy and cheap because bitcoins are not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Small businesses may like them because there are no credit card fees. Some people just buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping that they’ll go up in value.\n",
      "Acquiring Bitcoins\n",

      "Owning Bitcoins\n",
      "Bitcoins are stored in a online locker known as “digital wallet,” which exists either in the cloud or on a user’s computer(HDD or pendrives). The wallet is a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive bitcoins, pay for goods or save their money. Unlike bank accounts, bitcoin wallets are not insured by the FDIC so the government has no control over it.\n",
      "Anonymity\n",
      "Though each bitcoin transaction is recorded in a public log, names of buyers and sellers are never revealed – only their wallet IDs. While that keeps bitcoin users’ transactions private, it also lets them buy or sell anything without easily tracing it back to them. That’s why it has become the currency of choice for people online buying drugs or other illicit activities.\n",

      "Now, let’s focus on what is a fork. Bitcoin code is open source and can be accessed by anyone. As a consequence, developers can alter the code for their benefit. But this alteration may not be acceptable to all the members of the bitcoin community. Then the developer fork the project creating his own version that co-exists with the original bitcoin.\n",
      "Everything isn’t perfect on this earth and everybody tries to improve the things. Forking can be considered as a kind of improvement in the crypto community. Zclassic is a cryptocurrency with the optional ability to keep the sender, receiver, and amount private in a given transaction. And who isn’t aware of the power of bitcoin?\n",
      "Rhett Creighton announced the plan in early December 2017. This fork will collate the power of bitcoin and privacy of Zclassic to deliver a whole new coin called “Bitcoin Private”. Bitcoin has been forked previously as well, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited to name a few. But this fork has created quite a rage in the crypto market.\n",
      "Its snapshot date is February 28th, 2018 as mentioned on its official website. It also announced that the holders of bitcoin and Zclassic will be eligible for BTCP and will be distributed at a 1:1 ratio. For instance, if you own 0.54 BTC and 20 ZCL, you will have 20.54 BTCP. A total of 20 million coins will be created by combining the circulating supply of BTC and ZCL.\n",
      "We are only 6 days away from the launch, hence if you are interested in acquiring BTCP, start investing in Zclassic as it is cheaper compared to bitcoins. You can buy using trusted exchanges and wallets.\n",
      "Good Luck!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private will support peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary. The transactions will be fast. Bitcoin Private will use the same privacy technology as ZClassic.\n",

      "The simplest way to think of this is to think of Bitcoin as anything else you’d have the capacity to buy with enough money. For example, one can buy a car/house/food with money.\n",
      "Bitcoin was developed through technology that executes completely online. It is stored virtually, on wallets or exchanges. Everything is online and one can remotely transfer and send value to anyone online (stored in bitcoin as a currency). One can’t touch their bitcoins the same way one can touch physical things such as a dollar bill, computer desk, a tree etc.\n",
      "In short, Bitcoin is a virtual currency built by lines and lines of code (computer program). It’s called a crypto currency because it’s encrypted by code that can’t be messed with.\n",
      "So bitcoins can be “traded”, i.e. bought and sold on an exchange. For example, if you have 50 USD and if you want to convert them to Euros, or any other currency what should you do? You’d go to a forex exchange service which will offer you the currency you’re looking for, at a given exchange rate or fee for the transaction.\n",

      "Bitcoin trading really is not much different to any other asset you can trade - maybe just a bit more volatile, but that is a good thing if you want to trade it! You will have to devide whether or not to trade the asset (bitcoin) itself or some derivative (financial “bet”). I recommend the latter as it allows you to participate in both bull and bear markets. If you simply buy the asset (Bitcoin) you can only participate in rising prices. The derivative also allows you to leverage your position. Having that said : LEVERAGE IS A DOUBLE SIDED SWORD! Whenever you trade with leverage make sure you are mentally ready to lose everything that is on your trading account (in other words: make sure not to put too much money on your trading account).

Bitcoin was introduced on 31 October 2008 to a cryptography mailing list, and released as open source sorftware in 2009. Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into a public ledger. This activity is referred to as mining and miners are rewarded with transaction fees and newly created bitcoins. Besides being obtained by mining, bitcoins can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.\n",

I would always advise this to anyone who wants to get involved in cryptocurrency before they put ANY cash into an ICO or towards a cryptocurrency exchange.\n",

      "Definitely Changelly in my opinion. In 2014, one of the biggest exchange platforms of the time, Mt. Gox, collapsed - leading to a loss of 650.000 Bitcoins. Hundreds of thousands of users who were holding cryptocurrency on Mt. Gox lost all of their funds - just like that! And sadly, there is no guarantee that something like this won't happen again. This is why you really need to carefully choose which cryptocurrency wallet you want to trust with your funds.\n",
      "So what are the alternatives for storing your cryptocurrency safely?\n",
      "There is a number of different options, the cheapest one being paper wallets.\n",
      "A paper wallet means that you print out the private and public keys to your bitcoin storage wallet. Those printed keys grant access to your funds, and losing your paper wallet also means losing access to your coins! So make sure to make several copies and store them in a safe or give one to someone you trust, for example your parents. But of course a paper wallet can easily be lost, burnt or destroyed in any other way - which is why they are not the optimal storage solution.\n",
      "The best solution for storing your coins are hardware / cold storage wallets.\n",
      "Such wallets store your coins offline, and therefore protect them from being hacked.\n",
      "It's basically a small hard drive (which would be indestructible, in the best case scenario) that securely contains your cryptocurrency wallet information.\n",
      "There are a number of hardware wallets available, and many companies have come out with new products or added new features to their offline wallets as demand has increased a lot recently.\n",
      "Store your assets in a wallet that you control the keys to:\n",
      "If you don't control the keys to your assets then you don't control what happens to them. If your assets are on an exchange or an online wallet then those third parties control them and you are leaving the responsibility of keeping them safe in their hands.\n",
      "When trading, use 2 factor authentication (2FA) on all exchanges:\n",
      "If you have assets stored in exchanges in order to trade them, make sure to enable 2FA as this adds a very good layer of security to your account. For example, if your password was to be compromised an attacker would also need access to your 2FA code in order to log in to your account. 2FA codes are usually sent via text message so this means that the attacker would need to be able to read the text message in order to gain access.\n",
      "Be careful when sending assets to other addresses:\n",
      "When moving assets around it can be easy to accidentally send assets to the wrong address and due to the nature of cryptocurrency, transactions are irreversible. What I like to do is send a very small amount of an asset to an address that I intend to send large amounts of assets to. If that transaction goes through correctly, I move the rest of my assets knowing that I have the correct address.\n",

      "I suggest storing your coins in a cold wallet.\n",
      "What is a cold wallet?\n",
      "A ‘cold’ wallet is a decentralised wallet that will store your cryptocurrencies offline. The wallet is computer-generated and is either referred to as a ‘paper wallet’ or a ‘cold wallet’ and is not hackable. The wallet will generate two keys that you need to take note of:\n",
      "Public Key.\n",
      "Often referred to as a public address, this is essentially the same as your sort code and account number. You can give people your public address and they can send you the corresponding crypto currency. You can also view your transactions on the blockchain by using your public key.\n",
      "Private Key\n",
      "A private key is essentially the same as your bank pin, security code and security questions all combined! If anyone gains access to your private key, they can go into your wallet and empty it without a trace!\n",
      "DO NOT SHARE YOUR PUBLIC KEY WITH ANYONE OR STORE THIS IN A PLACE WHERE SOMEONE CAN SEE IT\n",
      "When creating your wallets, I recommend following the strategy that I use to minimize risk.\n",
      "All of my private keys for the various wallets I have are kept off my computer on a memory stick, I strongly suggest you do the same.The reason why I store my private keys only on a memory stick is to reduce the chance of a hacker gaining the key off of my files from my computer. As long as your computer is connected to the internet you are vulnerable for being hacked.\n",
      "When creating your wallets, I suggest using an incognito browser to make sure that no cookies, temp files or any other information is saved. Once the public and private key are generated, write them down on a piece of paper, and copy and pasted them on a word document - which is only saved on an offline memory stick. You can then access the keys only when you need to, reducing your exposure to hackers significantly.\n",
      "Hot Wallets - Exchanges\n",
      "A hot wallet is a wallet that is connected to the internet and the purpose of a hot wallet is to allow transactions to occur. The exchanges that you are registered with use hot wallets. The problem with hot wallets is that due to them being connected to the internet hackers can easily access them.\n",
      "Somebody I know had all of his Ethereum stolen as he clicked on a fake link that directed him to his exchange account, he typed his login details in and within the next hour all his funds were stolen. He thought this would never happen to him, as we both knew about fake links and scams, but as I’ve said before, scams are getting increasingly sophisticated and are often mistaken by even the most careful investors.\n",
      "The main problem with crypto wallets is that they require a certain level of technical knowledge to operate. The process of storing crypto currencies in wallets is relatively simple, it works like this:\n",

      "CYRPTOCURRENCY FROM EXCHANGE (HOT WALLET)\n",

      "Combining digital security knowledge as well as secure bitcoin storage is important if you don’t want your accounts hacked and bitcoins drained. Remember – bitcoin transactions are not reversible. To send or spend bitcoins, one must have access to both public and private keys. Private keys, especially, must be protected.\n",
      "Types of Bitcoin Wallets\n",
      "There are a few types of bitcoin wallets and they have varying security mechanism to ensure the safety of private keys.\n",
      "Simplistically, bitcoin wallets can be divided into 5 types: desktop, mobile, online, hardware and paper wallets. Some types may overlap or used in combination with each other.\n",
      "Here are 14 secure bitcoin wallet options you can choose from.\n",
      "A) Desktop wallet\n",
      "Bitcoin desktop wallets offer one of the highest (if not the highest) level of security in terms of bitcoin storage.\n",
      "You must download the software to your computer and perform bitcoin transactions from desktops, so it may not be practical for some people.\n",
      "This option can be technical and confusing for bitcoin newbies.\n",
      "Bitcoin Core\n",
      "Bitcoin Core is the first and original wallet. Using this option means having control over both your public and private keys, which ensures safe storage. However, Bitcoin Core also requires a lot of space as the software comes with data on every bitcoin transaction ever performed. According to the download page, as of 2016 you need 65GB of free space – this number will increase as more bitcoin transactions happen every day.\n",
      "2. Armory\n",
      "Calling themselves ‘The Only Open-Source Wallet With Cold Storage and Multi-Signature Support’, Armory is one of the popular options around for desktop bitcoin wallet. Private keys are stored in an offline computer, which means that only someone with access to the physical location of the computer (it is kept secret) can steal bitcoins.\n",
      "B) Mobile Wallets\n",
      "Bitcoin mobile wallets are not only accessible and practical\n",
      "Many also incorporate other layers of security to ensure users’ bitcoins are not compromised.\n",
      "It is a good idea to keep only a small amount of bitcoins in mobile wallets while keeping the rest in more secure options.\n",
      "Mycelium\n",
      "Mycelium is one of the safest and most recommended options for secure bitcoin storage on mobile. Boasting ‘bank grade security’, it boasts Hierarchical Deterministic wallets, private key deletion and ‘watch only’ accounts.\n",
      "2. Wirex\n",
      "This full-fledged bitcoin service provider offers both online and mobile secure bitcoin wallets. What differentiates Wirex from the rest is its ease of use while not compromising security. Users get multi-signature (‘multi-sig’) wallets and can enable 2-factor authentication (2FA) for both app and Wirex-linked email address, making third-party breaches hard.\n",
      "C) Online wallets\n",
      "Online bitcoin wallets are wallets that are easily accessibly on the Web via any device so long as it can be connected to the Internet.\n",
      "It is easier and faster to make transactions via online wallets due to its accessibility.\n",
      "Phishing, malware, insider hacking or plain lack of digital security knowledge makes it easy for hackers to steal bitcoins from online wallets.\n",
      "The failure of two huge bitcoin exchanges (Mt Gox and Bitfinex) make people wary of such services.\n",
      "Although the bitcoin wallets recommended in this section have high reputation, we suggest you keep larger amounts of bitcoins in other types of wallets.\n",
      "Blockchain.info\n",
      "Bitcoin Block Explorer - Blockchain is the most popular (8 mil wallets) website everyone uses to perform and check bitcoin transactions. They are often praised for its ease of use, multi-country support, and cross-platform capability. Aside from web wallet, Bitcoin Block Explorer - Blockchain is also available on desktop and mobile app.\n",
      "2. BitGo\n",
      "A respected name in the Bitcoin world, BitGo is considered a leader in blockchain security. BitGo is great for individuals and businesses who prefer near-instant transactions. Usually, a bitcoin transaction needs between 3-6 confirmations, taking about 30-60 minutes.\n",
      "D) Hardware Wallet\n",
      "The method of choice for many bitcoin holders to keep significant quantities of bitcoins\n",
      "Hardware bitcoin wallets are user-friendly and portable.\n",
      "All of these Plug-and-Play options give users complete control of their own bitcoins.\n",
      "Keepkey\n",
      "One of the biggest fears of a bitcoin holder is unknown transaction that depletes all of their bitcoin savings. KeepKey helps to alleviate this fear. Users will have to approve each outgoing transaction on the KeepKey device, manually. Private keys remain in the device, which is also PIN-protected in case it falls into the wrong hands.\n",
      "2. Trezor\n",
      "A trusted name and endorsed by many key Bitcoin community leaders, Trezor is small and simple to use. It features security against malware and disaster recovery in case of theft or loss.\n",
      "E) Paper Wallet\n",
      "Bitcoin paper wallets are safe against hackers as the bitcoins are brought offline.\n",
      "Users have control of their bitcoins at all times as they keep own private keys.\n",
      "The problem, however, is storage. Paper can be destroyed, torn, fade or otherwise lost.\n",
      "Unlike hardware wallets, there is no recovery mechanism for paper wallets – so lost bitcoins are lost forever. This is something you need to keep in mind if you want to use this option.\n",
      "BitcoinPaperWallet\n",
      "Users can print tamper-resistant paper wallets with this services to keep their bitcoins offline. Offering additional security tips, designs and supplies, this website is a favorite among bitcoin cold storage advocates. It even has a handy video showing you how to use this paper wallet.\n",

I will detail each of the different categories, web, mobile, desktop etc. and the best wallets for category. I should also point out that the categories are ordered by the security level.\n",
      "Web-Wallets (least secure)\n",
      "Online web-wallets are websites or even online exchanges that allow storage. As I mentioned above, this is the least secure option as it usually involves leaving the management of your private keys to a web server. Web servers are prone to hacking, and users must also trust the online wallet operators. It is however a really convenient way to keep a couple dollars worth of bitcoin online for quick and easy payments. If you have large amounts, then never keep it all in a web-wallet.\n",
      "Here are some good web-wallets:\n",
      "Bitcoin Block Explorer - Blockchain – Simple user interface, no ID verification needed to use it. HQ based in Luxembourg\n",
      "Greenaddress – Synced wallet that works across your devices. Browser extension and smartphone.\n",
      "Coinbase standard wallet (insured storage) – Super popular, based in US. No fees to send BTC to other Coinbase wallets.\n",
      "Coinbase cold storage (for advanced users) – Extra safe multisig wallet with redundancy in case of website failure.\n",
      "Mobile Wallets\n",
      "A mobile or smartphone wallet is, as the name suggests, a bitcoin wallet on your smartphone. Mobile wallets are great, because it is really easy to scan QR codes with your phone’s camera to make quick payments to friends, merchants ad shops that accept bitcoin. The names may vary, but mobile wallets are as unsafe as web-wallets in terms of private key security. This is because most mobile apps automatically update by themselves. If a hacker gets access to the developer’s iTunes / GooglePlay account then they could potentially infect and steal millions of users wallets as their next update gets pushed through. Nevertheless, this type of wallet is great for having small amounts ready to pay when you are out and about.\n",
      "The best mobile wallets for iOS and Android are:\n",
      "Breadwallet – simplest wallet for iPhone and more recently available on Android\n",
      "Mycelium – HD wallet with many features including support for Ledger & Trezor (hardware wallets), Tor (a privacy-focused mesh network), watching addresses.\n",
      "AirBitz – Easy to use and great for less technical users\n",
      "GreenBits – Functional Android wallet support for Ledger + Trezor.\n",
      "Desktop Wallets\n",
      "Desktop wallets are apps installed on a desktop computer or laptop. Many people store significant proportions of their bitcoins in desktop wallets as these are much safer than web or mobile wallets. If you asked me a few years ago, I would have said that this is the safest way to store bitcoins. Now, in 2017, with all the backdoor hacking stories, I would prefer using a variety of offline wallets (desktop, hardware, paper) to store my bitcoins. If you are comfortable with ensuring your PC’s security and/or using a Linux system (Windows is considered the least secure operating system) then this may be a relatively secure option for you. A desktop wallet could also be an option for keeping a certain percentage of your portfolio.\n",
      "I really like these desktop wallets:\n",
      "Electrum – most popular desktop wallet because of simplicity. Users have to write down a seed when creating their wallet. Can be integrated with the Trezor or Ledger hardware wallets.\n",
      "Armory – a very secure and feature-laden desktop wallet for advanced users. Offline signing options make this extra secure. Note: this wallet requires BitcoinCore to function. Bitcoin Core is the original Bitcoin desktop wallet, but it needs to download the whole blockchain (>100GB large!) to work. I have not listed Bitcoin Core here for this reason.\n",
      "Hardware Wallets\n",
      "Hardware wallets are very sophisticated semi-cold storage (mostly offline) systems. A piece of hardware is used to store the private keys to your bitcoins. Every time you want to send coins then you’ll just connect the hardware wallet to a PC and then take it offline again once the transaction is complete. Keep in mind that you have to buy hardware wallets, unlike the other types of storage solutions which are mostly free. Although you still have to trust the hardware-wallet manufacturer & suppliers, many people claim that this is the safest type of bitcoin wallet.\n",
      "Here are some popular hardware wallet systems:\n",
      "Ledger\n",
      "The Ledger Nano S is a multi-currency hardware wallet, featuring a screen for payment validation and architected around a secure element for maximum protection of your assets.

With Trezore, transactions are completely safe even when initiated on a compromised or vulnerable computer. Because the use of Trezor is very easy and intuitive we believe it will help Bitcoin adoption among people not familiar with the security issues.\n",
      "Visit Website\n",
      "Note: some experts suggest that hardware wallets are not real cold storage (completely offline) because they require USB connections to make transactions.\n",
      "Paper Wallets\n",
      "In the opinion of many people using a paper wallet is the most secure cold-storage solution available (more so than hardware wallets). With a paper wallet you only have to trust the wallet-creating software and the physical location that it will be stored in (usually a safe in a bank or at home). As with all super-secure solutions, this is the least convenient as you’ll need to create a new paper wallet every time that you want to send bitcoins somewhere. If you are planning to hold on to your cryptocurrency for a long time without spending it, a paper wallet could be a super-safe option for you.\n",

      "private keys are often stored in a protected area of a microcontroller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext\n",
      "immune to computer viruses that steal from software wallets\n",

      "If you are not familiar with the notion of hardware wallets, you may wonder what would be the advantages versus a paper wallet or an encrypted private key on a computer.\n",
      "The main principle behind hardware wallets is to provide a full isolation between the private keys and your easy to hack computer or smartphone. Vulnerabilities of modern PCs and smartphones are well known, and if you keep your private keys there (private key = your bitcoins) it’s just a matter of time before you’ll get hacked and lose everything.\n",
      "Picture: The Ledger Blue hardware wallet.\n",
      "A paper wallet may be secure, but only until you want to use your funds, requiring importing your private keys on your computer and if you think a password encrypting your keys is enough, malware is smart enough to wait for the inevitable decryption before sweeping your funds.\n",

While the company is still fairly new on the market, it has managed to gain a lot of popularity thanks to its impressive number of Initial Coin Offering listings, but also due to its low trading fees. In our review, we will attempt to outline everything that you must know about Binance, including how it works, the crypto pairs that you can exchange, trading fees/limits, security aspects, and customer support. Those who visit Binance for the first time will quickly notice that the platform offers two options for digital currency trading- basic and advanced.

      "3.Investing/Trading in Bitcoin/Other coins- Favourable.\n",
      "Why is it reasonable to believe so?\n",
      "1.Future of Blockchain in india\n",
      "One of the reasons that blockchain's furure is promising is that our Government think tank - Niti Aayog is looking at various applications of Blockchain in fields such as PDS (Public distribution system), Land records etc. Even in the Budget 2018–19 our Finance minister said “The government will explore use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in the digital economy.”\n",

      "2.Future of Bitcoin as a payment system\n",
      "Bitcoin is supposed to be used as a payment system. That is, if you have Bitcoins, you can use them to pay for anything and everything instead of using money. Thus, Bitcoin enables worldwide transactions to be very fast and convenient with low charges. Thus Bitcoin is supposed to be a substitute for money. The Indian government in the Union budge 2018–19 that Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Altcoins ) are not legal tenders- which implies they can't be used to buy things (as a substitute for money)in India.\n",
      "3.Future of Investing/Trading in Bitcoins :\n",
      "Now, what if instead of using Bitcoins, one trades in Bitcoin? Most of the people reading this will only be interested in Investing/trading in Bitcoins. Trading /Investing means buying and holding Bitcoins/Altcoins and selling when the price get higher. Investing can also be said to be buying stocks of companies who are supporting/using Bitcoins.\n",
      "Unlike popular belief(from misinterpretations), there is no bad news from our Govt.for people like us. Let me quote from the Union budget 2018–19\n",
      "“The Government does not consider crypto-currencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system.

      "As we can see, there is no mention of Trading/Investing in Bitcoins or other Cryptocurrencies. That being said, I think it is reasonable to expect RBI to impose taxes on the profits earned through trading Cryptos. At present, there is no tax and I think, this will change in the near future. But, that is it. Nothing like “banning Bitcoin” is expected . Even the share market has taxes on profits they why not Cryptos?\n",
      "Now for those who think trading or buying Bitcoin is very risky and it is a bubble etc. I have 2 things to share:\n",
      "1.Risk and profit are directly related, the more profit you expect in the least possible time, the more riskier the investment will be ( even in Share markets).\n",
      "2. In the long run maybe Bitcoin etc may turn out to be a bubble. Yes, there are chances. But, does that mean you can't make money out of it? Absolutely not. Even if you think Bitcoin is a bubble, you can still make money out of it if you have done enough research , make wise decisions and know the risks associated.\n",
      "In short- Bitcoins and Altcoins are risky investment. If you jump into it blindly, you will make huge loses. But, you can make immense profits if you learn and understand how to predict their trends, what all affects the price changes etc. Do your research, Learn about them . There are lots of books on the topic.\n",

      "2) The journey of Bitcoin in 2017 maps a highly-volatile but consistent upward movement, with the price of the cryptocurrency peaking out at a whopping USD 19,000 in December from about USD 1,000 recorded in January.\n",
      "3) The stupendous rise drew the attention of media, investors, cryptocurrency traders as well various regulatory bodies globally as well as in India. Since the start of 2017, Bitcoin kept reaching new highs, boosted by increasing global acceptance and the prospect of high returns. Bitcoin's value fluctuated below USD 2,000 in the first five months, however, it gathered the government's attention well before it reached a new high of USD 2,000 mark on May 20.\n",
      "4) In March, the Reserve Bank of India had cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currency, including Bitcoin, about the potential financial, legal and security risks arising from the usage.The central bank had said the use of virtual currencies like Bitcoins are not authorised by RBI and could result in the breach of anti-money laundering provisions. This led to a new direction of talks around whether or not Bitcoins will be regulated by the Indian government. In June, after Bitcoin reached another new high of USD 3,000, the government appointed a panel comprising officials from the Finance Ministry, NITI Aayog, Ministry of Information Technology, State Bank of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to decide whether India should regulate or legalise virtual currencies such as bitcoins.\n",
      "5) A revolution of sorts, bitcoin is a currency system based on Mathematics, and hence, is completely devoid of authority and the commodities of the physical world. For a very long time, all the world’s currencies have been subject to either commodity or political authority, until 2009. That was the year when someone under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto introduced bitcoin to the world.\n",
      "A revolution of sorts, bitcoin is a currency system based on Mathematics, and hence, is completely devoid of authority and the commodities of the physical world.\n",
      "6) To understand the current techno-revolution of bitcoin, let us consider some of the conceptual facts of the bitcoin network from a currency perspective. Bitcoin transactions are fundamentally computed with the process of mining. At a process-level, mining involves a computer (or a user) solving a mathematical challenge. A block of bitcoin is processed each time the problem is successfully solved and a 64-digit solution is reached. Moreover, the miner earns new set of bitcoins.\n",
      "7) The degree of difficulty of these mathematical puzzles can be varied, in order to ensure consistent production of bitcoins on a daily basis. While as of today, there are about 15 million bitcoins in existence, the number of bitcoins that ever could be in circulation is hard limited to 21 million units. Hence, bitcoin reduces the uncertainty of money flowing in the system mathematically.\n",
      "8) In fact, with the introduction of ‘irreversible transactions,’ there is now no need for a trusted intermediary or third parties. With third-party dependency no longer being a limitation, one can generate, store and transact with this evolved form of currency on one’s own.\n",
      "Also, the mathematically supported transaction system enables pseudonymous ownership of money, thus increasing the privacy and security by relying on proof-of-ownership.\n",
      "9) In order to receive Bitcoin, the person only need to have a Bitcoin address that is fundamentally a 27 to 34 characters long string of numbers or letters. The same string acts as a virtual address of users, where the bitcoins are shipped off. However, since the address need not have any tangible existence, the same safeguards the identity of users transacting online via bitcoins.\n",
      "Although there is a chance of money laundering, Bitcoin predominantly seems to be a favourable choice for spreading financial inclusion, especially in a country like India.\n",
      "10) The Proof-of-ownership system, as put to practice in the digital world of cryptocurrency, has proven to be more robustly scalable and inclusive than the proof-of-identity frameworks. The same must be leveraged by the Government bodies and private sector for banking the unbanked section of any nation’s economy.\n",
      "11) In essence, Bitcoin provides a new and upgraded foundational architecture for global currency systems. At the same time, it also reduces the cost and infrastructure requirements for the fragmented financial systems that can completely rely on this new, advanced and superior protocol for money.\n",
      "profit taking\n",
      "Those who invested 750 USD each in the 8 largest cryptocurrencies of the time in January 2017 (total investment 6,000 USD) were in June 2017 by a staggering 125,000 USD richer than before. Here, every investor should be aware that massive profit-taking is taking place in the market.\n",
      "A successful investment also requires a suitable and logical investment strategy. Given four-digit growth rates, this can of course also be called \"disbursing\", waiting or reinvesting. However, the overall market capitalisation shows very clearly that not only a large amount of capital flows into the cryptocurrency market, but is also withdrawn. Profit-taking is a normal process on the financial market.\n",
      "Panic of amateur investors\n",
      "Buy Bitcoin, invest Bitcoin, trade Ethereum etc. Since the rapid price increase in 2017, a broad media interest in cryptographic currencies has been established. As a result, many \"amateur investors\" also wanted to participate in these price gains and still want to do so. Encouraged by forecasts such as \"Bitcoin can be worth €50,000 by the end of the year\" or \"Ethereum ist das neue Bitcoin\", a lot of money was invested without the necessary background knowledge about the technology (block chain) or the financial market. Ultimately, they were hoping for further price gains in the three-digit range.\n",
      "But when prices start to fall, which is quite normal and you can observe this process on the world's stock markets on a daily basis, then comes the fear of losing money. In the worst case, the Bitcoins and the Ethereum are sold again with loss to avoid an alleged total loss. This panic reaction then also triggers an increased sales volume on the market and prices continue to fall.\n",
      "I do not want to say anything against smaller investors. However, you can see from the collapse of prices and the panic selling that many small investors are on the market without knowledge and patience. This ignorance is mercilessly exploited by large speculators. Those who let themselves be guided only by their greed for quick profits and invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum without any sense or understanding will most likely lose their money.\n",
      "Professional investors and traders\n",
      "Wherever there are high growth rates, large investors and professional traders operating for example Ethereum Trading are not far away. After all, the already considerable price changes can be further exploited with various levers and margin trading. With a total market capitalization of e. g. Ethereum 18 billion USD, 2 billion active trading volume is already sufficient to influence the price in one direction.\n",
      "2 billion now sounds like a lot, which it certainly is, but for an investment company it is not. Here it is possible to calculate exactly how much is bought or sold, or to control it via trading bots.\n",
      "For example, a bot can be programmed to repeatedly buy a certain amount of Ethereum in a certain time interval. (All 60 seconds the Bot buys 100 ETH around the clock. That would be 1,440 x 100 ETH = 144,000 ETH per day = 28.8 million USD per day | 864 million USD per month. For example, the market could be led to believe that the price is rising steadily over a period of 1 month and the price is rising, as more investors are buying later in the hope that the price will continue to rise.\n",
      "Any market that can be easily influenced attracts bitcoin traders and speculators, as you could see at the first bitcoin hype. But after the rapid increase, however, there was also the rapid collapse when the profits were realized and the capital was withdrawn from the market.\n",
      "The so-called Pump & Dump scheme can be seen, especially with smaller cryptocurrencies. Here a smaller coin with low volume is pushed until it shows two or three-digit growth rates (pump). Now the speculator waits until he finds a few \"fools\" and enters the highest price. Then landslides are sold (dumped) and often still bet on falling prices in parallel. The speculator earns double, the small investor looks into the pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued its third warning about trading in virtual currencies such as bitcoin. The price of one bitcoin hit a new high of $12,000 in the US.\n",
      "Not that anyone expected RBI’s warnings to cause a dent in appetite for bitcoins. China went much further and banned cryptocurrency exchanges earlier this year, but trading moved to over-the-counter platforms, and the ban caused only a temporary blip in the bitcoin rally.\n",
      "The irony is that the more bitcoin rallies, the more people it draws into the rally, regardless of the fact that heavyweights such as investor Warren Buffett and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller have called it a bubble. Supporters of virtual currencies are betting that they will ultimately be accepted as alternative currencies, making them immensely valuable, especially since supply of the currency is limited by design. The bitcoin bubble may well get much larger until there is clarity on its use as a currency.\n",
      "For now, multiple hacks, thefts and scams haven’t taken away anything from the charm of trading in bitcoins. The number of new users is doubling every three-four months on Indian trading platforms. In fact, in India, the rush for bitcoins has outpaced supply by a wide margin. As a result, there is a mark-up of around 15-20% to the international price; the price of one bitcoin hovered around Rs9 lakh on the Coinsecure platform on Wednesday at the time of writing.\n",
      "Given the stupendous rise in the price of bitcoin this year—it was at less than $1,000 at the start of the year—even staunch supporters now use the following caveat, “Only invest money you can afford to lose”. In other words, risks associated with this form of investment are very high.\n",
      "Nitin Sharma, an angel and crypto investor, says “There are a few different reasons why the average investor should not overexpose himself to cryptocurrencies. One, compared to even other high-risk asset classes, they are esoteric and one needs time to develop an appreciation for the underlying technology and the fundamental need for such tokens or currencies. As the saying goes, one shouldn’t invest in something you don’t understand, at least at a basic level.” Sharma, who was formally a founding member of venture capital firm Lightbox, says it took him about four months studying and building that understanding before investing. On the other hand, a large majority of new participants are just chasing the price rise, which is a classic feature of a bubble.\n",
      "The fact that regulation is not clear is another risk. Bitcoin purchases and sales in India are undertaken under the premise that they are allowed because they aren’t explicitly disallowed. Do provisions of RBI’s Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) apply to bitcoin bought overseas and later sold onshore? Perhaps not, some lawyers argue, because FEMA doesn’t talk about virtual currencies specifically. In short, it’s all grey. If Indian policymakers worry, as China did, about the multiple Ponzi schemes that have spawned alongside the bitcoin rally, and ban trading of bitcoin platforms, traders could be in trouble.\n",
      "But on the other hand, with people such as the head of the International Monetary Fund making positive statements about digital currencies and with a large economy such as Japan giving bitcoin official sanction, an outright ban may not happen. Still, investors should appreciate the regulatory risks that are associated, especially given the lack of clarity from Indian regulators.\n",
      "Another feature they need to appreciate is that cryptocurrencies are difficult to value. “While I am bullish on the possibilities that decentralization opens up, it is hard to think about valuation of these new crypto assets. For bitcoin, depending on whether it is thought of as ‘digital gold’ (a store of value) or a currency to pay for purchases (a medium of exchange), you can arrive at vastly different estimates of what it can be worth in the future. Right now, it’s just guesswork,” says Sharma.\n",
      "Kunal Nandwani, CEO at uTrade Solutions, a fintech firm, worries about the mainstreaming of bitcoin, with the impending launch of futures trading on large platforms such as CBoE and CME in the US. “Bitcoin was meant to be used as a peer-to-peer decentralized currency. The whole idea was decentralization away from regulated and centralized financial systems. While there may be reason to cheer the bitcoin futures launch as validation of its credibility, are we losing the whole point of why Bitcoin was invented?” he asks.\n",
      "In fact, other commentators have argued that the rapid rise in the virtual currency potentially defeats its use as a currency; people may just prefer to hold it for appreciation, rather than use it for buying goods and services. Of course, this begs the question—if it isn’t being viewed as a currency by the majority of buyers, then what is the logic behind the price rise?\n",
      "But while there are multiple risks, bitcoin has also given some traders the thrill of earning returns of 1600% in the past year. This appears to be the fastest appreciation per unit of time for any major investment opportunity; with that sort of return, it’s little wonder people are ignoring the warnings all around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin in India is just like anyplace else. How to go from a system we know, to a system we don’t.\n",
      "Regulation is the buzzword these days. Government is trying, through committees and internal research, to take the proper path regarding cryptocurrency, i.e. digital currency. The Governor of The Reserve Bank of India says:\n",
      "I think these virtual currencies will certainly get much better, much safer and over time will be the form of transaction, and that’s for sure.\n",
      "Bitcoin was reportedly introduced to India in 2014. Since then, studies have concluded that Bitcoin is not illegal. The concerns of government notwithstanding, it appears the lack of clarity in regulation itself could be one of the problems.\n",
      "Bitcoin can be loosely defined as a type of digital currency operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government issued currencies. You can’t hold a bitcoin in your hand. Instead, your Bitcoin balance is kept in what is called a public ledger, which is also referred to as a digital wallet. The transactions that occur there are between willing participants.\n",
      "A similar process can be seen using eBay’s rating system known as feedback. Here buyers can rank the transactions they participate in. Ebayers, as the participants of eBay’s marketplace are known, post feedback limited to positive, neutral or negative. Buyers and Sellers are very protective of their feedback scores, and many disputes arise through the process.\n",
      "With Bitcoin, a program known as Blockchain is by comparison much more transparent, with the built in time-stamp function, and its back chain (or back looking) function, it provides a much clearer picture of the peer-to-peer transaction. And since there is no centralized database, disputes are easy to mitigate, as only the immediate participants are involved.\n",
      "A.T. Kearney reported that in Indian malls, surveys showed 90% of transactions are in cash, and that the decentralized nature of those transactions bode well for the Bitcoin model. India is perfect as a society to be at the forefront of developing a vibrant cryptocurrency economy.\n",
      "A recent RBI Bulletin reported: About 40 percent of the population across the country does not have bank accounts. This could prove a boon for cryptocurrencies with technology expanding greatly throughout the country. Accounts could be formed in remote areas without the need for brick and mortar banks.\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies are not without problems. Companies developing their own currencies have degraded into Ponzi type schemes that create a black eye for the whole industry. Bitcoin itself has been victim to unscrupulous practices by some participants, but those practices have not been deemed to be systemic problems, merely human ones.\n",
      "What is paper money but a promise to back it up? Bitcoin is a promise that IS backed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright.\n",
      "In 2013 RBI issues warning for Indian investors about Bitcoins. The notification is still valid today. Bitcoin is highly volatile and unregulated.\n",
      "Government of India is concerned about the illegal activities happening with Bitcoins. Lots of Ponzi schemes are being run on the the name of Bitcoins. Bitcoin is being used to do hawala.\n",
      "Still RBI is actively working on regulating Bitcoins. They know that banning will not stop people from using Bitcoins. The best way would be to regulate in order to protect people’s interest. Currently RBI and SEBI are in talks to identify Bitcoin either as a currency or a security. Both agencies want the other organisation to regulate Bitcoin. It is very difficult to track flow of Bitcoins. It is a major headache for the government.\n",
      "Once RBI formulates a plan, I think we can see wider adoption of Bitcoin around India.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No one knows for sure (with any degree of certainty). Having said that, most agree the future is bright. That statement does have a few caveats. The following is my prediction:\n",
      "Bitcoin itself as a protocol will evolve. Many people forget the simple fact that it is a protocol first and the money part just happens to be the first app written over it. Think of it like the Netscape browser written for (predominantly) HTTP. It was good at its time, but then other browsers took the mantle and Netscape was dethroned. The same analogy could apply to bitcoins (the money). It could be dethroned and for all we know Dogecoin or Litecoin could prevail.\n",
      "The Buying process of Bitcoins will have to be made much more simpler than it is at present. All indications point that the process will get more streamlined, so buying bitcoins will be an easy task.\n",
      "In most countries (US included), companies that trade Bitcoins onto the local currency would be regulated. More exchange companies will mushroom.\n",
      "Acceptance. Until and unless Buyers keep pressing / asking Merchant to accept Bitcoins, merchants will be oblivious to the demand. If you walk into a store and ask if they accept Bitcoins and they answer No, this is the expected answer. Repeat this scenario with 10 other Buyers asking the same and the Merchant will think differently. They just might start looking at Bitcoin acceptance.\n",
      "Much of the developed world where payment systems that enable instantaneous person-to-person payment are not available, would love to adopt Bitcoin. The barriers are the regulators and the almost near vacuum of local Bitcoin exchanges. Look at India - no exchange in India. Same can be said of Pakistan, Bangladesh, GCC, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand (though there are a few players in Thailand who are selling Bitcoins), North Africa, etc. There is a very large population that simply does not have access to buying bitcoins. Since they cannot buy it - they cannot trade with it. This will be changing in the coming months/years.\n",
      "Volatility will minimize. I won't say it will disappear, the public at large is too sensitive to everything the media spews out relating to Bitcoins.\n",
      "Arbitrage will almost be negligible.\n",
      "You will see the movement pickup speed with a few authoritative anchor users accepting Bitcoins. (See this excellent article by our resident Payments Maestro Brian Roemmele - Starbucks To Accept Bitcoin In 2014. by Brian Roemmele on Accepting Payments).\n",
      "As more and more larger corporations start offering Bitcoin as a payment alternative, many companies waiting in the shadows will jump onto the bandwagon. This chain-reaction trigger is very important for Bitcoin to survive. Many are waiting for the trigger.\n",
      "I don't think the price for the next 2-3 years will break $5,000 (the expectation of it going to $25,000 to $500,00 - will be bad for Bitcoins in my opinion, too many speculative money will enter the ecosystem, which will cause regulators to clamp down hard on Bitcoin). My personal estimation is that it will hover between $1,000 to $2,500 (for the next 24 months at least).\n",
      "Acceptance of Bitcoin as an alt. currency in developing countries would be very important (as opposed to outright banning it). I however, have my reservations on this. The regulators in the developing have a very myopic vision when it comes to alternative currencies. Such obtuse undertaking will kill Bitcoin (in a legal manner) in the developing world.\n",
      "The market capitalization indicates in some manner that the currency is now too big to collapse (not that it cannot happen), by a measure of its own self, it will most likely survive.\n",
      "Bitcoin will be featured regularly in the Remittance World (a sure sign of its success would be the World Bank reporting remittance figures on the Bitcoin platform) - How this will be done, is debatable and questionable, but I'm leaning in as a proponent.\n",
      "Snap Payments with Bitcoins for Websites, Freelancers, etc. would be enabled. This means, very quickly accepting $25 in Bitcoins, which are in turn converted to Euros and available in your pre-paid Debit Card (all by inserting some simple code on your website to accept the payment). Think BitPay or Coinbase on steroids, globally.\n",
      "Currency Brokers will be trading and dealing with Bitcoins more regularly.\n",
      "Bitcoin exchanges in the West (perhaps US, or UK) will prosper and take over in volume (provided international clients are allowed to hop in and trade).\n",
      "Incorporation of Bitcoin payments within Social Media would be the norm. You would definitely see native or plug-in based activity around Bitcoin. Think Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.\n",
      "Apps not related to money, but related to the open-ledger system of the Bitcoin protocol will start emerging. I'm absolutely lost when it comes to giving such examples, but I am sure, someone out there is thinking of a kick-ass way of using the Bitcoin protocol and building a non-payment app on top of it.\n",
      "Currencies based on the Bitcoin protocol or modified protocol, will start seeing a market themselves for specific purposes. It could very well be that Litecoin might dominate the Remittance market, or changing Linden Dollars to Litecoin. Or Mastercoin is used on boards like Warrior Forum or Digital Point (the Affiliate Marketing Ecosystem) or Peercoin is what is most accepted and traded in South Asia or South America. Such patterns and/or segmentation may very well emerge.\n",

      "It’s a ‘newer’ exchange with a great user interface, fast loading charts, lots of cryptocoins big and small, good response time from their helpdesk if you run into some trouble you want an answer to. Not for nothing that they are called the ‘people’s exchange’! It has the lowest exchange fees off all exchanges, only 0.1% for buy and sell trades! Most exchanges use a 0.2-0.3% exchange fee. Their withdrawl fees are also the lowest to be found in the market: as an example: WaltonChain between binance and Kucoin. 0.4 WTC to withdraw any amount on Binance and only 0.1 WTC on KuCoin! Not surprisingly they already made it to the top 25 exchanges in the world in merely 4 months! You can even vote for your favorite coin to be listed.\n",
      "It’s got the major coins listed like Ethereum, Litecoin, Neo but also the smaller coins like ETHLend, Request Network, Power ledger, Elixir, OmiseGo, Publica,Bountry0x, Waltonchain, Dent, Dragonchain, and many many more! It’s listing new coins almost on a daily basis and they just listed Raiblocks!\n",
      "There are trading pairs against BTC, ETH and USDT but also against NEO and KuCoin shares. Kucoin shares give you a passive income in dividend every day since the platform returns 50% of its fees to people who own Kucoin and keep the KuCoin shares on their platform.\n",
      "The kucoin exchange doesn’t require verification, just your own email address and a password and you’ve got an account! It’s also one of the only exchanges that distribute GAS when keeping NEO on their platform.\n",
      "Also check out the Coinigy tool. With that referral link, it’s free for one month to try it out. It’s an easy to use tool which shows you live charts of most of the exchanges out there and is able to link your trades in one place! Very useful tool for traders! You can easily see trend lines, support and resistance levels, moving averages, trading volume,… so you can do your own analysis off a coin!\n",

      "People are still starstruck when they dream about having bought bitcoin 5 years ago for a couple of bucks and become millionaires now. But that is not going to happen again.

      "1. Only risk 1 percent to 5 percent of assets.\n",
      "\"This is a new technology,\" said Kelly. \"Things break. This is the internet in 1995.\"\n",
      "With an asset that fluctuates in price so much, the potential for growth is exponential — but so is the loss. If the investment doesn't work out, losses can easily be absorbed, Kelly pointed out.\n",
      "2. Don't sell too soon.\n",
      "Kelly recommended holding on to the currency, even if it's up 20 percent or 30 percent. \"Once there's momentum, you hold onto this thing,\" he said.\n",
      "3. Do not panic when coin drops 50 percent.\n",
      "Understand the volatile nature of digital currency. \"These things can move 20 percent to 30 percent in a day,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello,\n",
      "In my opinion the right time to buy bitcoins is when the market crashes which usually happens twice in 3 months ! Where all cryptos fall more than 20% that is the time you buy and when the market cover ups you end up getting 20–40% straight gain dont be greedy and just sell out and wait for the next crash and then book your profit again ! Or exchange your crypto into some stable currency and then while the crash you can covert them again !\n",

While the company is still fairly new on the market, it has managed to gain a lot of popularity thanks to its impressive number of Initial Coin Offering listings, but also due to its low trading fees. In our review, we will attempt to outline everything that you must know about Binance, including how it works, the crypto pairs that you can exchange, trading fees/limits, security aspects, and customer support. Those who visit Binance for the first time will quickly notice that the platform offers two options for digital currency trading- basic and advanced.

When user-base will increase you might have to wait for months to signup (this is what happened with EthexIndia - an Ethereum exchange, it has been 6 months but their signup process has not resumed due to surge in demand).\n",

      "The Major reasons why Cryptocurrency are going/gone down today:\n",
      "**India’s finance minister statement :**\n",
      "Officials have said cryptocurrencies are used by criminals to launder money. India, which has likened the market to a Ponzi scheme, on Thursday vowed to eliminate their use.\n",
      "The Indian finance minister said his government would take “all measures” to remove crypto-assets in “financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system”, Arun Jaitley told parliament.\n",
      "*Facebook ban on Cryptocurrency advertising:*\n",
      "Facebook recently announced that it would not allow the cryptocurrency advertisements especially for the ICOs. Many of the ICOs were heavily advertising on Facebook in order to gather the new investors and in order to gather the hype as well. Since Facebook is not allowing that any longer, many of the ICOs would not be able to market them heavily.\n",
      "*US Cryptocurrency crackdown:*\n",
      "The SEC is also examining the ICOs carefully now. It has even stopped to some of the ICOs which it thinks are suspicious as well. Owing to this very reason, when it comes to the ICO market, the regulation and the regulatory hurdles are increasing as well. Cryptocurrency is a decentralized form of money. Therefore, whenever there is any regulatory hurdle or whenever there is an attempt to control it, it would certainly fall as well.\n",
      "*South Korea Cryptocurrency crackdown:*\n",
      "South Korea is also cracking down on cryptocurrencies heavily as well. The main reason for this is that majority of the global investors in cryptocurrencies reside in South Korea. Even though, the population of the country might be small but the number of investors or the density of investors is actually pretty high. This is one of the main reasons why any change in the regulatory framework in South Korea would actually impact the entire cryptocurrencies space as well. South Korea has made it harder for children as well as criminals to trade in cryptocurrencies. The exchanges are required to collect the documents and verify the identity before allowing them to trade.\n",

      "Here’s the short answer: no one really knows, but you can make educated guesses.\n",
      "In a bull market, everyone’s a genius. The market is purely speculative right now, and completely irrational. You have multi-billion dollar valuations on projects with no working product. On the other hand, you have projects that are solving complex technical issues valued outside the top 100.\n",
      "It’s the wild wild west, and you must do your own research, and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.\n",
      "With that said, I invest based on the following beliefs on where I see the market going, and they may be an unpopular opinion compared to the get rich quick schemes being circulated:\n",
      "The blockchain/crypto space right now is still in its infancy, therefore, I think the best investments you can make right now are in infrastructural and protocols projects, which will help foster the development ecosystem of the entire industry. More devs = more growth and more projects.\n",
      "It’s too early to invest in consumer focused projects (some exceptions apply). For example, would Facebook really be viable as a business when the internet was first introduced? No, not at all. The timing would be way too early. The industry hasn’t matured, the adoption isn’t there, and the foundational technology hasn’t gotten there yet. Will you make money investing into consumer focused coins? Sure, but do you think these coins will be around after a market crash? Highly unlikely.\n",
      "I don’t believe coins that say they focus on a specific niche or use case have any real value. (ie: Dentacoin - extreme example, but for sake of argument) - Ask yourself this, why have another token that essentially is just executing smart contracts, if you can simply use Ethereum? There are lots of scams out there like this which sound like it’s a viable idea, but it’s really worthless. Aside from scams, you also have very inexperienced entrepreneurs who have misguided beliefs, or opportunists who simply are creating a token to run an ICO to capitalize on crowdfunding and raising millions of dollars out of thin air and a whitepaper.\n",
      "I think there are certain industries that have a lot of synergy with, and can benefit immediately from blockchain technology, namely - Finance & Logistics. Currently banking infrastructure is highly inefficient, and blockchain tech at its core provides digital trust, and eliminates counterparty-risk. The moment you can do that and you can increase liquidity and easily move money around the globe, the more money and time you can save. Same with logistics, there are real benefits that businesses can derive value from right now. Such as the traceability and guarantee of authenticity of goods in the supply chain, combating counterfeit goods, etc.\n",
      "With those in mind, there are a only a few picks that I’ve narrowed down that I think are worthwhile, and have satisfied my criteria of:\n",
      "Team - Is the team credible, and experienced enough to see the project through? Do they have any advisors or board members? Etc\n",
      "Technology - What’s unique about their technology? Do they have a working product? Do they really need to use the blockchain or can they really just be using a database?\n",
      "Token - What gives the token value? Are the economic structures of the network incentivizing an increase in value, therefore making it a good investment? What’s the distribution of tokens? How is it valued? What’s the circulation?\n",
      "Timeline - What’s their roadmap like? Do they look like they have a good business strategy laid out? Are they prioritizing and executing on the right things?\n",
      "Industry Adoption - Do they already have any partnerships or real world usage? What’s the benefit and value? Any case studies?\n",
      "Taken into consideration all the above, I would suggest looking into:\n",
      "VeChain - A PwC incubator company, that started out offering a hardware/blockchain, which focused on using RFID/NFC tags, and combining that into immutable records on the blockchain, offering companies secure, and full transparency, into their supply chain. Vechain is now expanding into becoming the world’s first BaaS (Blockchain as a service), for enterprise companies (Think of it as a full-service Ethereum focused on Fortune 500 companies). They already boast impressive partnerships with DNV GL (the world’s largest accreditation company with over 80k enterprise clients), as well as officially bringing Jim Breyer onboard as an advisor. Look up Vechain and you’ll see they are already partnered with a dozen multi-billion dollar corporations.\n",
      "Raiden - The scalability solution for Ethereum. This is a no-brainer as scalability is one of the most pressing obstacles that needs to be overcome for mass adoption.\n",
      "Chainlink - They’re middleware solving the huge oracle problem. They essentially help connect smart contracts with real world data. This is a massive undertaking that will be incredibly valuable not just to the crypto space, but in bridging the gap between blockchains and the real world. There is a huge connectivity issue, and Chainlink is the only real solution right now, offering a decentralized network of oracles to feed data to/from smart contracts. Helping them realize their full potential.\n",
      "WaltonChain - Similar to VeChain, and also solving the supply chain and IoT issues by connecting their own specialized hardware, with the blockchain for immutability of data and records.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After several months of trading cryptocurrencies and watching the market become saturated with “hype” coins, I started to concentrate on platform coins with working products. Platform coins are blockchains that other blockchains can be built off of— like Ethereum. Nearly every utility token was built off Ethereum’s blockchain. In addition, they often have smart contract and ICO capabilities.\n",
      "Platform coins are also great to hold because they often have “proof of stake” consensus, or variants like Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT) in Neo’s case. Long story short, holding these type of coins in a wallet will give you dividend-like payments. Because of this incentive, many investors hold these coins in a wallet, helping to stabilize the price in the long run. In return, you’re helping secure the network.\n",
      "There’s many platform coins like this, but only a handful have their actual product launched with tokens being built on them. For instance, despite the enormous potential of Cardano and EOS, their finished main-net blockchains won’t be ready for a while. So their current billion dollar valuations make less sense than Neo for instance.\n",
      "Here’s my favorite cryptocurrencies to invest:\n",
      "Ethereum: This coin is at the top in terms of market cap for a reason. As mentioned, almost every token was built off their blockchain. Though Ethereum currently has a slower, more expensive POW protocol, they will eventually convert to POS this year. When this happens, expect its price to surge even further. Other methods to make Ethereum less bloated include sharding, plasma, etc. Many partnerships have been formed with the intent of making Ethereum mainstream— including JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, Intel and more. Even NASA has given a grant to have a blockchain built off Ethereum!\n",
      "Neo: A great working blockchain with new ICOs every week. Neo has very fast transactions and a profitable staking protocol— even when your wallet is offline. In addition, Neo has many partnerships including Microsoft and big companies in China. Their main negative— and maybe only negative— is that they aren’t as decentralized as other blockchains. Neo was built to fully comply with Chinese regulation. That’s bad news for idealists, but great news for long term investors.\n",
      "VeChain: I first heard of VeChain in an article about how Chinese companies were using blockchain to verify whether goods were counterfeit or not. The main blockchain mentioned in the piece was VeChain. I was floored by how little hype surrounded this coin with a working product. The more I read about them, the more impressed I was. Like Neo, VeChain has a great team and POS protocol. And at the time of this writing, VeChain has gone up about 600%. A secret no more. Read more about VeChain to learn of their numerous Chinese partnerships. Maybe the best on this list.\n",
      "Stellar: Partnerships galore— like IBM, Stripe and Deloitte- and a transaction speed of a few seconds, Stellar operates as a non-profit. Stellar’s platform also functions as an efficient currency exchanger between government-backed currencies, such as dollars to euros. Lastly, launching a token on Stellar is super easy. Simple tokens can be created in a matter of hours because of Stellar’s simple programming.\n",
      "2018 should be a great year for cryptocurrencies in general, but especially these platform coins. Volatility should continue in the market, but if the bulk of your investments are the coins above you’re much more likely to weather any storm and come out ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course this is a subjective question completely dependent on opinion because most of the cryptocurrencies have potential to increase in price. So take this answer with a grain of salt.\n",
      "I think the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now is Ripple (XRP). Ripple is starting to be accepted by banks globally because it shaves costs and time off per transaction. This means that other banks will catch on, and it will spread like wildfire. As it does this, the price will go up. Another reason I think Ripple is due to go up is because it is yet to be included on Coinbase, the worlds most popular place to trade Bitcoin. Coinbase currently supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Because Coinbase makes money per purchase, they're going to want to incorporate popular cryptocurrencies to make more money. Ripple is certainly a popular currency, so I think Coinbase is going to support Ripple soon. When this happens, Ripple will much easier to trade and the price will go up. The last reason I want to include is that the low price is drawing in money. Everybody curses themselves out because they “almost invested in Bitcoin when it was $1.50,” and seeing this price is drawing in people who think that Ripple could experience what Bitcoin experienced.\n",

      "I think if you are looking for a long term investment, crytpocurrencies are still at very early stage. Every one of them comes with big risk and probably high return. To put things in perspective, last Bitcoin was around 450$ and Ethereum was less than 10$ and they both grown to 3 times and 7 times respectively. Nobody can assure you that they will grow further or they will die out, this is the call you will have to take based on your risk appetite.\n",
      "I am betting on the following crytpocurrencies, mainly due to their use case, technology and people behind them. Do understand that when I am suggesting the following crytpocurrencies, I have not yet put my money on all of them. I am still studying there updates and market sentiments.\n",
      "Ethereum: Ethereum is a decentralised infrastructure for computational power. Similar to Bitcoin, it connects computers worldwide and gives a blockchain network to run smart networks. You can think of it as CPU for the computer.\n",
      "Golem: Golem is still in its alpha phase and it will take another 2 years for the project to be ready for public use. Golem is built on Ethereum and is promoted as the new World Supercomputer. It uses the idle computational power of user’s computer, laptops, mobiles to built a decentralised supercomputer. Anyone can use Golem to run their own projects from rendering an image to running website. For the layman it is a decentralised version of AWS, Google Cloud etc.\n",
      "Sia: Torrents gave you power to dowload files from multiple servers/computers at once. A little part of the file is downloaded from various different locations. Sia helps you store you files on multiple connected computers. It distributes your files over the decentralised network and sine only you have keys to your files only you can view it. You can also lend the space on your computer to the Sia network to earn.\n",
      "Ripple: Ripple is trying to replace the Dollars for the transactions between financial institutions. Funded by Google Ventures. it enables banks to send real time internation payments without need of any centralised authority. Banks have low cost, faster global payments systems using Ripple’s network. No more waiting for 3 days in a wire transfer.\n",

      "KROPS: Farmers Have a New Hope\n",
      "If We’ll Need a 70% Increase in Food Production by 2050, Farmers Will Need a Helping Hand\n",
      "Luckily, they have one.\n",
      "If you haven’t heard of KROPS yet, you will. The KROPS app is empowering farmers all over the world to, for the first time, run the agriculture and farming businesses like actual farming businesses—with access to actual merchants, financial resources, and an even playing field in which to trade commodities.\n",
      "Let’s imagine, for a moment, that you’re a farmer. Perhaps you already are one, and you work in a developed nation that has access to cash-flow-functional businesses that empower you to operate at the highest level.\n",
      "Maybe you’re a farmer in a certain part of the world, and in order to function properly, you have to have all your banking needs taken care of by a bank that’s overseas.\n",
      "Now let’s speculate a little more. What if you’re a farmer in a third world country—and you have zero access to financial institutions, or ways to monetize your business?\n",
      "The truth is, you’re more than likely our last example if you live on planet Earth. In fact, it’s more likely that you live in the same country as the farmer in our last example if you live on planet Earth—and your time is spent hastily searching for your next food source, or source of fresh water.\n",
      "The population is booming, and by the year 2050, our world is going to require a 70% increase of food production just to maintain our current functionality and distribution throughout the world. That’s startling.\n",
      "Now, the not-so-secret-secret is, we have the power to save the world and end hunger right now. KROPS is the major force behind this movement, and it’s the one cryptocurrency that’s putting power in the hands of farmers—and changing the way farms all over the world operate.\n",
      "Right now, there are 570 million farms worldwide, with 80% of the world’s food being produced by family farms, and 38% of land on the Earth is used for agricultural purposes. You rarely see anything like that anywhere else in the world. This massive impact is responsible for 3.2 Trillion—or 6.3% of the Gross World Product.\n",
      "How is KROPS helping this movement take off?\n",
      "KROPS launched in January of 2017 in the Philippines. In that first month, 9 transactions were made for a total of $1,200 USD. By March, the app had 3,000 users registered, $16.7M in transactions as of December, and a total of 100M USD in product inventory. October 2017 saw 4.2M transact—in just one month. Today, the users have doubled and the total product has tripled. That’s an upward trajectory and unprecedented rise.\n",
      "How is this much needed dream coming to fruition?\n",
      "CapchainX.\n",
      "The KROPS ICO is being exclusively handled by CapchainX—a global cryptocurrency exchange platform. As KROPS begins to grow in value over the years to come, CapchainX will be the sole source by which this watershed movement is invested—and that’s the perfect point by which to acknowledge the finest point of the KROPS value proposition:\n",
      "If you invest in KROPS, you will own a part of the KROPS company. This is unheard of in the crytpo universe. This would be like owning part of Alibaba or Amazon before the year 2000. Why? Unlike other ICO’s which are not attached to any kind of actual value—the KROPS ICO is allowing users and investors to not only earn tokens for mere fractions of what they’ll be worth in 2018, but you can actually own part of KROPS in the process.\n",
      "Now, let’s check back in on our farmer. He still lives in a third world country, but now, it’s considered a developing nation. Why? With KROPS, he he’s connected to a seamless, digital, financial ecosystem. He can easily take his crops and products, and scale them to buyers all over the world.\n",

Bitcoin was humanity’s first definition of what it means to be a cryptocurrency, but it is a complicated creature that relies on many special functions and components.

It also has cryptographic hashing, so that traders can use a system of public and private keys to safeguard their identities.\n",

      "Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum’s core innovation, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a Turing complete software that runs on the Ethereum network. It enables anyone to run any program, regardless of the programming language given enough time and memory. The Ethereum Virtual Machine makes the process of creating blockchain applications much easier and efficient than ever before. Instead of having to build an entirely original blockchain for each new application, Ethereum enables the development of potentially thousands of different applications all on one platform.Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property.This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middleman or counterparty risk.\n",

      "Coinbase shows users different settling times based on the age, history and jurisdiction of the user’s legal address. They go above and beyond compliance with local law, licensing requirements and conservative accounting practices.\n",
      "The reason that Coinbase typically quotes a longer settlement time than other exchanges or payment processors is because they are more sensitive to the possibility of 3rd party access, legal recourse or a user demand for rescission (refund or cancellation).\n",
      "When you sweep money from a checking account or credit card into Coinbase, you may have rights under your bank-card agreement that allows you to reverse the transaction for a certain period of time. Depending on the region or institutional agreement, you might be permitted 3 days or even 5 days. This rescission privilege also helps the institution to block misuse of your account.\n",
      "(Some institituions accepting your checking account transfer or credit card skirt the refund/settlement period by applying local laws in their own jurisdiction or by classifying your payment as an exchagne for products that you have already received and accepted (such as food in a restaurant). But not Coinbase.\n",

      "Coinbase is positioning themselves as a financial exchange for mainstream business and consumers engaged in legitimate and compliant business. They believe that Bitcoin is gradually evolving into a payment and storage mechanism for legitimate commerce. This belief is integrated into their mission and long-term vision.\n",
      "Bitcoin and other coins are currently popular with early adopters, geeks and speculators. But as movement in and out of cryptocurrency generates profit and loss (and because online payment networks are sometimes used to hide a crime or launder money), Coinbase wants to demonstrate to both regulators and users that they are fully and enthusiastically engaged in best practices for AML (anti-money-laundering), KYC (know your customer) and even RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act).\n",
      "I occasionally have a beef with the commissions, forking decisions, or customer service delay at Coinbase—but I have always admired their dedication to compliance and transparency.\n",
      "If you need to keep some of your wealth or transactions off the grid—or if you prefer that some trades are completed without recourse, confirmed identity or oversight—consider using an alternate exchange service, a mixer or an anonymized coin like ZCash or Monero (they have privacy features built-in). But, if you are paying a college tuition and need proof that you qualified for the early payment discount and that the tuition is tied to a certain student, semester or course registration, then Coinbase is the right partner for you.

      "This year has been an immense success for Bitcoin considering its price being somewhat higher than 900$ at the start of this year, and culminating to about 13,500$ just this week.\n",
      "This cryptocurrency is being as aggressive as ever with no intention of ceasing it’s rise.\n",
      "Exceeding the expectations of the its creators, Bitcoin is considered to be used as an alternative currency whether you want to pay or invest. Bitcoin’s price depends on the will of the people who want to pay for it. It seems that an enormous amount of people are using this crypto currency even so that in just a few months there have been up to 20 million people who signed up for it. For as long as people rapidly join the bitcoin frenzy, it is more likely to move the crypto currency into the mainstream and be used around the world which would mean a dramatic increase in its value.\n",
      "Aside from all that, the continuous rise of Bitcoin’s price has made global investors wanting to shield their own currencies which have been deflating. But general public who might be suspicious about the safety of their money being upheld by the central banks, got remarkably interested to bitcoin because of its nature to be less influenced by any state’s economy.\n",
      "Therefore, the main reasons why Bitcoin is rising include:\n",
      "The decentralized network and the inability to control the transactions one by one\n",
      "The popularity of the cryptocurrency itself, which is growing as we speak (along with its price)\n",
      "No banks or governments involved in the entire transaction model\n",

      "An extremely secure network which uses a dual-sided cryptography for each transaction\n",

      "Difference Between Litecoin And Bitcoin?\n",
      "You can use Litecoin almost anywhere, where you can use Bitcoin. Since its release, it has been the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, and traders have quickly adopted it. Five things make Litecoin different.\n",
      "1. Speed\n",
      "Litecoin is based on the same open source code behind Bitcoin, with some noticeable differences. For being silver in Bitcoins gold, one of the main differences between two cryptocurrencies in the speed of their transactions.\n",
      "The confirmation of the transaction rate plays an important role in how quickly a currency is approved. Bitcoin acknowledgments typically last about ten minutes and have steadily increased over periods of up to 2,548 minutes.\n",
      "Litecoin generates blocks about four times faster than bitcoins, Litecoin can confirm the legitimacy of transactions much faster and process a much larger number of transactions over the same period of time(2.5 minutes).\n",
      "2. Number of Coins\n",
      "One of the reasons why some cryptocurents have an internal value is due to their limited supply. Once a certain number of Bitcoins (btc) or Litecoins (ltc) were created, this was the case.\n",
      "There can be no new coins at this time. While Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million coins, Litecoin will reach 84 million marks.\n",
      "3. Cost\n",
      "The cost of sending a Litecoin is around $ 0.09, while Bitcoin is currently pushing around $ 5.00. This is an immediate advantage of Litecoin over Bitcoin for small transactions, because sharing a $ 10 Uber with a friend makes no sense to most people if you have to pay an additional $ 5.00. Litecoin offers the possibility to pay daily high-priced goods, which are added very quickly.\n",
      "4. More secure\n",
      "This fast processing time also helps maintain a safe environment by reducing the double-spending – a dry cough in which the attacker spends the same money twice for two different transactions.\n",
      "5. Cryptography algorithms\n",
      "This may not seem like an advantage at first glance, but since Litecoin uses scrypt hashing (instead of SHA-256), the mines can not be accelerated using parallel processors, as is the case with bitcoin mines. This has created a much more equal playing field than the arms race that has been made bitcoin mines. Litecoin uses scrypt, which requires significantly more memory to compute; this means it requires more computing power and is more expensive to run, but it also deters brute-force attacks.\n",
      "Future of Litecoin\n",
      "The growth of Litecoin’s market capitalization is not expected to slow down in the foreseeable future, which will result in an increasing number of enterprises taking over Altcoin or together with Bitcoin or as a full replacement .\n",
      "In addition, much work is being done to improve the Litecoin network. This will improve the speed at which transactions will be further verified and above all will enable atomic swaps.\n",

      "When I bought Litecoin with INR, I used Sragy just because it was recommended to me and worked well. I also use some other digital currency exchange also. If you want to hold Litecoin for long term, I recommend a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S but they aren’t ideal for someone trading frequently or one that supports litecoin like Sragy wallet where you can store all your Litecoin online.

But to further strengthen this platform, the company also trades on the cryptocurrency exchanges using bots that focus on the market’s volatility rather than capturing profits from buying low and selling high. Depending on the size loan you make, they will share with you their daily profits – averaging about 1% per day. Many different moving parts here, which is why it didn’t place higher on our list – but we love BitConnect and their affiliate program – awesome revenue stream!\n",

      "I think that people should invest in Bitcoin now, because you can get started fairly easily and with little starting investment money. Also big time investment companies are starting to add bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their portfolios.\n",
      "There are a lot of ways that people are making money these days using Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. If you want to get started you need to down load a wallet, as well at a trading platform that allows you to buy and sell BTC. I suggest Bitcoin Wallet - Blockchain and Coinbase - Buy/Sell Digital Currency.\n",
      "Now as far as making money using BTC or other cryptocurrencies there are several ways that people are making money and growing there portfolios. I have listed a few of the most common ways below.\n",
      "Buying and Holding:\n",
      "When it comes to investing in Bitcoin, there are several investment strategies that people are taking. The first being, Buying and Holding, which is basically just buying bitcoin and holding onto it until the market price goes up to a place where you feel it is time to sell and your bit coin for more than you purchased it for. Make sure that you never bet more than you are willing to lose.\n",
      "Day Trading: (not recommended)\n",
      "Your second option for Bitcoin investment would be, Day Trading, which can be more of a gamble. Day trading is when you play the bitcoin market by watching for sharp hikes/dips in the market where you can buy and sell for a profit within fairly short intervals. Keep in mind that there big players out there waiting to take the new guys money.\n",
      "Bitcoin Mining:\n",
      "Your third option is ,Bitcoin Mining, which was cheap to do in the early days of Bitcoin. Unfortunately those days are gone and if you are going to mine Bitcoin today in 2017, your are going to need to invest in some serious equipment and you are also going to need to mine on a large scale for mining to be a viable source of income.\n",
      "Bitcoin Investing Software\n",
      "Lastly there is Bitcoin investment programs that you can enroll in that will help you grow your bitcoin without having to start with a large initial investment. The growth is slow but the return on your investment is guaranteed. These are the best ways for beginners to start learning about and working with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Also, if you’re an organized criminal trying to hide funds in a country with poor banking institutions and need to secure your money for shipment abroad. Otherwise it’s probably not a good fit for you.\n",
      "Currencies by their very nature thrive on stability, and bitcoin investing strongly implies an expectation for the currency to gain significant value. If the product does work as an investment, it fails as a currency and that’s the fundamental problem with bitcoin speculation. As long as people continue to use it as an investment vehicle it will continue to be volatile, and that will prevent it from being adopted in countries with a strong, stable economy.\n",

      "Bitcoin cannot “register” with the SEC since it's not run by a single company. There's no BTC Inc. or LLC that exists.\n",
      "The original vision of bitcoin is one of a peer to peer cash system; i.e one of disintermediation and decentralization or in other words one of taking out the middle man, the centralized single point of failure (SPF). The release of the BTC white paper in January 2009, immediately following the 2008 crisis, driven in large part by the abuses of an SPF system, is very telling.\n",
      "All other crypto currencies hail from that concept and many if not most are centralized to various extents and operate under a companies, for now. Those could “register”.\n",
      "“Registering” opens the door to the need to comply with many rules that can only function under an SPF system: an entity concentrating information and power and without which the entire system fails. Thus defeating the peer to peer original purpose.\n",
      "In the case of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) it also opens the door to “investment qualification” under KYC and AML rules. Those limit the opportunity to invest to “qualified investors”: net worth of $1M minimum or $250K yearly income; i.e. a very small percentage of the population. All under the guise of “protecting the consumer”.\n",
      "Short if deciding to let people take their own risks and responsibilities for the decisions and investments they make, with the political backlash that entails. It is likely that the cryptocurrency space will undergo some sort of regulation; nevertheless, current laws are ineffective and incompatible with the concept. Until regulations are adjusted they are likely to hinder progress and to drive the crypto space further underground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, having certain government arms involve in cryptocurrencies actually proofs to noobs that cryptocurrencies might actually be a good thing despite all the badmouthing by same government and media outlets, cryptocurrencies showing a great resilience against all oppositon and then getting opposers to even begin swallowing their own words and embrassing the idea, but that aside, the very idea of cryptocurrencies is to have a kind of money that is self regulating without the effort of any particular body, the blockchain runs a software that obeys certain rules only, you either obey those rules or you are kicked out of the network only to be able to rejoin when you make corrections in the areas where you have defect, so, the very ideology is to have a network that needs no trusted regulation, which actually is the case, but now having external regulation like sec to monitor certain crypto activities is actually good because it will end up protecting alot of silly people from loosing their money to scammers\n",

      "Blockchain allows for regular people to be in complete control of their funds without relying on a third-party institution (ie banks and credit card companies).\n",
      "Indeed, the decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies has long been regarded as a good thing by crypto users who wish to remain as anonymous and tax-free as possible. However, a few large-scale incidents have made plain the US government’s seemingly limited ability to protect crypto users from theft and fraud, a situation that is only exacerbated by a lack of solid, uniform legal framework.\n",
      "SEC would step in to address ICOs for registration violations even if there were no claims of fraud. On December 21, 2017, former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said on CNBC’s fast money that a serious crackdown on crypto by the SEC was imminent: They’re in line for some serious regulatory responses to all of this and that will be forthcoming after the first of the year. Now, platforms that trade digital currencies would have to register with the SEC.\n",
      "The SEC is worried investors in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies think they’re getting the protections and benefits of a registered exchange, when they’re not. So, we can say, At the very least, the regulations would also provide some groundwork for states who have no legislation on cryptocurrency.\n",

      "It is not a bad thing, but is a good thing. Regulation and consumer protection are often good, not bad, even if also sometimes imperfect, downright bad at times, or in need of reform. The “fear and panic” about this is misguided. It is neither realistic, necessary, or even wise to think that we can or even should be able to be completely free of all government regulation and oversight when it comes to matters of this kind. We are also fortunate to have a society and political process in which people can work and advocate for good and beneficial rules regarding such regulation, as well as reform when necessary. It is not good to have a complete “wild west” situation regarding these matters. Now with that said, it does however seem that great reform may be needed when it comes to regulation of commodities trading in the area of precious metals. Since cryptos are to be regulated as commodities too, aside from the “securities” aspect, the same concerns would apply.\n",

That wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing because they control everything else you can trade or invest in. It would standardize the marketplace. Yes it would give credibility to the market but it always comes at a cost. The big players would be running their business model in Cryptos. You would have to follow the big players in order to profit. Buy when they buy and sell when they sell. The reason that this is so frustrating is that they work on a long time frame and they buy at the low and sell at the high which is opposite of what the Retail daytrader does. The Retail daytrader is on a short time frame perspective, buys at the high, and sells at the low.\n",

To make Bitcoin, you need to purchase equipment that is very expensive. So making Bitcoin is just like a new type of business in its own right.\n",
      "So if the Bitcoin price drops, all people lose, if it grows, all people holding it gain. That’s it. If Bitcoin forks, like it did with Bitcoin Cash, then as an owner of a fraction of Bitcoin, you get the equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, or any other forks. These are done automatically as an algorithm, no company does this by itself.\n",
