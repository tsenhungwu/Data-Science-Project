## Project Title
1. Yelp Data Challenge – Sentiment Analysis and Recommender System

    •   Through this project, I solved two main problems:
    
    (1) Classified negative and positive reviews by a self-defined metric. After the model fitting, gained insights about 
        what words usually contribute to the negative or positive review. A restaurant can summarize what's the main 
        aspect such as food or service that resulted in a lower rating.
            
    (2) Used unsupervised learning to cluster users into groups. Identified and understood the common user preference 
        within each of the group by inspecting the cluster centroids. Built a restaurant recommender system using 
        collaborative filtering and matrix factorization based on users’ past visits and ratings.

## Motivation
Each data science project is unique and has different problems that need to solve. I found doing data science projects are interesting and encourages me to achieve goals not just project oriented but also a continuous learning on a whole data science career path.
