# Data-Science-Project
My name is Tsen-Hung Wu. I have complied all my hard works in school projects in the Data Science Project.

## Project Title
1. Yelp Data Challenge – Sentiment Analysis and Recommender System

    • Used NLP techniques, such as stemming, lemmatization, and TF-IDF, to extract features from unstructured review text data
    • Built language understanding models including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to classify positive 
      and negative reviews using NLP techniques. Logistic Regression achieved 0.9072 AUC on the test dataset
    • Used unsupervised learning to cluster users into groups. Identified and understood the common user preference within 
      each of the group by inspecting the cluster centroids
    • Built a restaurant recommender system using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization based on users’ past visits 
      and ratings

## Motivation
I have accumulated different aspects of knowledge in data science after each project completion.
Each of projects signifies what I have learned in the past and what I have achieved.
