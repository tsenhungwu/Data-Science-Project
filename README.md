# Data-Science-Project
My name is Tsen-Hung Wu. I have complied all my hard works in school projects in the Data Science Project.

## Project Title
1. Yelp Data Challenge – Sentiment Analysis and Recommender System

    •   Used NLP techniques, such as stemming, lemmatization, and TF-IDF, to extract features from unstructured review text data
## Motivation
I have accumulated different aspects of knowledge in data science after each project completion.
Each of projects signifies what I have learned in the past and what I have achieved.
