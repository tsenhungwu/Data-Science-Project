## Project Title
1. Yelp Data Challenge – Sentiment Analysis and Recommender System

    •   Through this project, I wanted to solve two main problems.
        (1) Classified negative and positive reviews by a self-defined metric. After the model fitting, gained insights about 
            what words usually contribute to the negative or positive review. A restaurant can summarize what's the main 
            aspect such as food or service that resulted in a lower rating.
        (2) Used unsupervised learning to cluster users into groups. Identified and understood the common user preference 
            within each of the group by inspecting the cluster centroids. Built a restaurant recommender system using 
            collaborative filtering and matrix factorization based on users’ past visits and ratings.

## Motivation
I have accumulated different aspects of knowledge in data science after each project completion.
Each of projects signifies what I have learned in the past and what I have achieved.
