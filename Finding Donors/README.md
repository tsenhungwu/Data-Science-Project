# Introduction
In this project, I used several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I then chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. 

This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.


# Objectives
Throughout this project, I have achieved the following tasks:

- Explored Data through visualizations.
- Data transformation on features having skew distribution.
- Constructed a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
- Optimized model by Bayesian Optimization.
- Feature importance report
